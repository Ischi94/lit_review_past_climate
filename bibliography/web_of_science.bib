Title = {Geochemical Records Reveal Protracted and Differential Marine Redox
   Change Associated With Late Ordovician Climate and Mass Extinctions},
Journal = {AGU ADVANCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Ordovician (Hirnantian; 445 Ma) hosts the second most severe mass
   extinction in Earth history, coinciding with Gondwanan glaciation and
   increased geochemical evidence for marine anoxia. It remains unclear
   whether cooling, expanded oxygen deficiency, or a combination drove the
   Late Ordovician Mass Extinction (LOME). Here, we present combined iodine
   and sulfur isotope geochemical data from three globally distributed
   carbonate successions to constrain changes in local and global marine
   redox conditions. Iodine records suggest locally anoxic conditions were
   potentially pervasive on shallow carbonate shelves, while sulfur
   isotopes suggest a reduction in global euxinic (anoxic and sulfidic)
   conditions. Late Katian sulfate-sulfur isotope data show a large
   negative excursion that initiated during elevated sea level and
   continued through peak Hirnantian glaciation. Geochemical box modeling
   suggests a combination of decreasing pyrite burial and increasing
   weathering are required to drive the observed negative excursion
   suggesting a similar to 3\% decrease of global seafloor euxinia during
   the Late Ordovician. The sulfur datasets provide further evidence that
   this trend was followed by increases in euxinia which coincided with
   eustatic sea-level rise during subsequent deglaciation in the late
   Hirnantian. A persistence of shelf anoxia against a backdrop of waning
   then waxing global euxinia was linked to the two LOME pulses. These
   results place important constraints on local and global marine redox
   conditions throughout the Late Ordovician and suggest that non-sulfidic
   shelfal anoxia-along with glacioeustatic sea level and climatic
   cooling-were important environmental stressors that worsened conditions
   for marine fauna, resulting in the second-largest mass extinction in
   Earth history and the only example during an icehouse climate.},

Title = {Formation, preservation and extinction of high-pressure minerals in
   meteorites: temperature effects in shock metamorphism and shock
   classification},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {The goal of classifying shock metamorphic features in meteorites is to
   estimate the corresponding shock pressure conditions. However, the
   temperature variability of shock metamorphism is equally important and
   can result in a diverse and heterogeneous set of shock features in
   samples with a common overall shock pressure. In particular,
   high-pressure (HP) minerals, which were previously used as a solid
   indicator of high shock pressure in meteorites, require complex
   pressure-temperature-time (P-T-t) histories to form and survive. First,
   parts of the sample must be heated to melting temperatures, at high
   pressure, to enable rapid formation of HP minerals before pressure
   release. Second, the HP minerals must be rapidly cooled to below a
   critical temperature, before the pressure returns to ambient conditions,
   to avoid retrograde transformation to their low-pressure polymorphs.
   These two constraints require the sample to contain large temperature
   heterogeneities, e.g. melt veins in a cooler groundmass, during shock.
   In this study, we calculated shock temperatures and possible P-T paths
   of chondritic and differentiated mafic-ultramafic rocks for various
   shock pressures. These P-T conditions and paths, combined with
   observations from shocked meteorites, are used to constrain shock
   conditions and P-T-t histories of HP-mineral bearing samples. The need
   for rapid thermal quench of HP phases requires a relatively low
   bulk-shock temperature and therefore moderate shock pressures below
   similar to 30 GPa, which matches the stabilities of these HP minerals.
   The low-temperature moderate-pressure host rock generally shows moderate
   shock-deformation features consistent with S4 and, less commonly, S5
   shock stages. Shock pressures in excess of 50 GPa in meteorites result
   in melt breccias with high overall post-shock temperatures that anneal
   out HP-mineral signatures. The presence of ringwoodite, which is
   commonly considered an indicator of the S6 shock stage, is inconsistent
   with pressures in excess of 30 GPa and does not represent shock
   conditions different from S4 shock conditions. Indeed, ringwoodite and
   coexisting HP minerals should be considered as robust evidence for
   moderate shock pressures (S4) rather than extreme shock (S6) near
   whole-rock melting.},

Title = {Tensions between individual and system change in the climate movement:
   an analysis of Extinction Rebellion},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Abstract = {This article examines tensions in the climate movement between solutions
   that involve individual consumption and behaviour changes and those
   involving more transformative systemic change. Although they are
   demanding system change, activists in Fridays for Future and Extinction
   Rebellion face accusations of hypocrisy based on their personal choices.
   This neoliberal appeal to hypocrisy is used to discredit, divide, and
   undermine the climate movement. Focusing specifically on Extinction
   Rebellion (XR), I examine how accusations of hypocrisy take form, how XR
   activists and supporters respond to accusations of hypocrisy, and how XR
   activists justify living a low-carbon lifestyle despite a strong belief
   that only system change can adequately address the climate crisis. Then
   I explore the disconnect between XR's focus on system change and their
   lack of specific goals that would drive forward the systemic changes
   necessary. While many activists call for `system change' what is missing
   is an understanding of what kind of system change is necessary and how
   it might be achieved.},

   Australia?},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},

Abstract = {The possible role of climate change in late Quaternary animal
   extinctions is hotly debated, yet few studies have investigated its
   direct effects on animal physiology to assess whether past climate
   changes might have had significant impacts on now-extinct species. Here
   we test whether climate change could have imposed physiological stress
   on the Tasmanian devil Sarcophilus harrisii during the mid-Holocene,
   when the species went extinct on mainland Australia. Physiological
   values for the devil were quantified using mechanistic niche models of
   energy and water requirements for thermoregulation, and
   soil-moisture-based indices of plant stress from drought to indirectly
   represent food and water availability. The spatial pervasiveness,
   extremity and frequency of physiological stresses were compared between
   a period of known climatic and presumed demographic stability (8000-6010
   BP) and the extinction period (5000-3010 BP). We found no evidence of
   widespread negative effects of climate on physiological parameters for
   the devil on the mainland during its extinction window. This leaves
   cultural and demographic changes in the human population or competition
   from the dingo Canis dingo as the main contending hypotheses to explain
   mainland loss of the devil in the mid-Holocene.},

   volcanic nutrient supply},
Journal = {NATURE GEOSCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {12},
Pages = {924+},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Late Ordovician (similar to 459-444 million years ago) was
   characterized by global cooling, glaciation and severe mass extinction.
   These events may have been driven by increased delivery of the nutrient
   phosphorus (P) to the ocean and associated increases in marine
   productivity, but it is not clear why this occurred in the two pulses
   identified in the geological record. We link both cooling phases-and the
   extinction-to volcanic eruptions through marine deposition of
   nutrient-rich ash and the weathering of terrestrially emplaced ash and
   lava. We then reconstruct the influence of Late Ordovician volcanic P
   delivery on the marine system by coupling an estimate of bioavailable
   phosphate supply (derived from a depletion and weathering model) to a
   global biogeochemical model. Our model compares volcanic ash P content
   in marine sediments before and after alteration to determine depletion
   factors, and we find good agreement with observed carbon isotope and
   reconstructed temperature shifts. Hence, massive volcanism can drive
   substantial global cooling on million-year timescales due to P delivery
   associated with long-term weathering of volcanic deposits, offsetting
   the transient warming of greenhouse gas emission associated with
   volcanic eruptions. Such longer-term cooling and potential for marine
   eutrophication may be important for other volcanism-driven global
   events.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The extinction risk assessment of a high altitude species with narrow
   distribution must primarily consider the intrinsic threats related to a
   small geographic range and to the effects of climate change on small
   scale. In this paper we estimated the current and future distribution of
   the narrow endemism of the Cottian Alps Carabus cychroides, one of the
   most localized ground beetles in Europe. This species was researched
   within the sites of historical presence and on the mountain ridges
   connected to them, recording its presence in new limited areas. The
   distribution of the species was modeled with fine-grained environmental
   variables with 25 m-resolution, in order to identify the presence of
   microrefugia and obtain an estimate as accurate as possible of the
   expected variation in geographic range. The results underline the
   faltering conservation status of C. cychroides, which in the most
   pessimistic greenhouse gas emissions scenario could become extinct at
   the end of the 21st century. Furthermore, its narrow distribution
   appears extremely fragmented and connectivity between suitable patches
   would decline rapidly in the coming decades. For these reasons and
   according to the IUCN Red List categories and criteria, we suggest that
   C. cychroides should be considered an endangered species. Implications
   for insect conservation The assessment carried out in this study
   contributes to the distributive and ecological knowledge of one of the
   most localized ground beetles in Europe. The methodology used to model
   its distribution constitutes an helpful alternative to the more common
   use of coarse resolution variables, making possible the identification
   of potential microrefugia and therefore a more accurate estimation of
   the size, fragmentation and connectivity of the geographic range of a
   species that occupies such a small area.},

Journal = {NATURE GEOSCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Pages = {862+},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Extreme warming at the end-Permian induced profound changes in marine
   biogeochemical cycling and animal habitability, leading to the largest
   metazoan extinction in Earth's history. However, a causal mechanism for
   the extinction that is consistent with various proxy records of
   geochemical conditions through the interval has yet to be determined.
   Here we combine an Earth system model with global and local redox
   interpretations from the Permian/Triassic in an attempt to identify this
   causal mechanism. Our results show that a temperature-driven increase in
   microbial respiration can reconcile reconstructions of the spatial
   distribution of euxinia and seafloor anoxia spanning the
   Permian-Triassic transition. We illustrate how enhanced metabolic rates
   would have strengthened upper-ocean nutrient (phosphate) recycling, and
   thus shoaled and intensified the oxygen minimum zones, eventually
   causing euxinic waters to expand onto continental shelves and poison
   benthic habitats. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the sensitive
   interconnections between temperature, microbial metabolism, ocean redox
   state and carbon cycling during the end-Permian mass extinction. As
   enhanced microbial activity in the ocean interior also lowers subsurface
   dissolved inorganic carbon isotopic values, the carbon release as
   inferred from isotope changes in shallow subsurface carbonates is likely
   overestimated, not only for this event, but perhaps for many other
   carbon cycle and climate perturbations through Earth's history.
   Warming-enhanced microbial respiration can explain marine anoxia
   patterns across depth, a key driver of the end-Permian mass extinction,
   according to biogeochemical modelling and geochemical proxy records.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Climate change is one of the main drivers of biodiversity decline
   worldwide, through shifting or shrinking habitats of species. Predicting
   the distribution of suitable habitats for species under climate change
   is essential for conservation planning. Cyamophila astragalicola is a
   specialist psyllid dependent on a spiny shrub, endemic to Zagros
   Mountains of Iran. The current study represents a modeling approach for
   lesser-known small invertebrates to assess their threat status.
   Ecological niche modeling was used to assess current suitable habitats
   of C. astragalicola, to develop model-based predictions of its habitat
   suitability under different climatic scenarios, and to assess the
   extinction risk of the species based on IUCN Red List criteria. Results
   revealed a sharp decline in suitable habitats (97.26\% and 99.8\% for
   the years 2050 and 2070, respectively) under the scenario of RCP 8.5.
   Further, under the two RCP scenarios, C. astragalicola was classified as
   IUCN Threat 2. A shift toward higher altitudes with lower temperature
   and higher precipitation was predicted. Results of modeling are based on
   abiotic factors only. Human interactions are not modeled; hence, the
   status of the species may be even more dramatic than the models may
   reveal. Generally, the results of this study indicate the high
   sensitivity of C. astragalicola to global warming. The narrow
   distribution range of the species coupled with the low dispersal ability
   can increase the risk of extinction. Ecological, economic, and social
   risks associated with the extinction need to be further evaluated to
   formulate future management policies.},

   Species Under Climate Change},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {AUG 17},
Abstract = {Coastal areas host some of the planet's most productive ecosystems,
   providing life-sustaining ecological services and several benefits to
   humankind, while also being some of the most threatened areas (e.g., by
   globalization, climate change, and biological invasion). Salt marshes
   are coastal habitats with a key role in food and shelter provisioning,
   sediment deposition, nutrient cycling and carbon storage. Spartina spp.
   is a genus of grass halophytes which occurs in salt marshes worldwide,
   and includes species with different invasive potential. We evaluated the
   effect of climate change in the distribution and invasion potential of
   five Spartina species (S. anglica, S. alterniflora, S. densiflora, S.
   patens, and S. maritima) at a global scale. Species distribution models
   (SDMs) were applied on species occurrence data and atmospheric
   environmental predictors (WorldClim 2.1) to project potential changes in
   habitat suitability and associated changes in distribution and species
   co-occurrence until the end of the century, across four Shared
   Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (i.e., SSP1-2.6 to SSP5-8.5).
   Projections showed a global trend for increasing species co-occurrence,
   with a general range expansion potentiated by increasing pathway
   severity. This study suggests that Spartina species can potentially
   benefit from climate change, predicting poleward expansions in the
   Northern Hemisphere for most species, with results pointing at increased
   conflict and invasion potential in Northern Europe and East Asian
   shorelines, already under strong invasive pressure. S. anglica is
   projected to remain a successful invader, with more severe scenarios
   likely favoring greater expansions. S. alterniflora exhibits very low
   expansion comparatively, despite exhibiting the same northward
   distribution shift. SSP1-2.6 produced the smallest change to species
   co-occurrence, suggesting a smaller potential for invasion-related
   conflicts, although still registering a potential net expansion for the
   Genus. Despite their limitations, SDMs can help establish general trends
   in climate change ecology and inform policymakers and environmental
   agents to ensure the correct management of these habitats and,
   ultimately, ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Climate change is a critical factor affecting biodiversity. However, the
   quantitative relationship between temperature change and extinction is
   unclear. Here, we analyze magnitudes and rates of temperature change and
   extinction rates of marine fossils through the past 450 million years
   (Myr). The results show that both the rate and magnitude of temperature
   change are significantly positively correlated with the extinction rate
   of marine animals. Major mass extinctions in the Phanerozoic can be
   linked to thresholds in climate change (warming or cooling) that equate
   to magnitudes >5.2 degrees C and rates >10 degrees C/Myr. The
   significant relationship between temperature change and extinction still
   exists when we exclude the five largest mass extinctions of the
   Phanerozoic. Our findings predict that a temperature increase of 5.2
   degrees C above the pre-industrial level at present rates of increase
   would likely result in mass extinction comparable to that of the major
   Phanerozoic events, even without other, non-climatic anthropogenic
   impacts. The linkage between temperature change and extinction rates in
   the fossil record is well-known qualitatively but little explored
   quantitatively. Here the authors investigate the relationship of marine
   animal extinctions with rate and magnitude of temperature change across
   the last 450 million years, and identify thresholds in climate change

Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {San Nicolas Island (SNI) foxes historically had the highest densities of
   the six subspecies of Channel Island fox, four of which were listed as
   endangered in the 1990s. As an island species, SNI foxes are inherently
   vulnerable because they evolved in isolation from many potential
   threats, and their small range features relatively simple and degraded
   habitats, limiting their population size and heightening susceptibility
   to climate-driven habitat changes. In the past decade, the SNI fox
   population has decreased by nearly half, spurring concern. Our analyses
   of 18 yr of trapping data suggest that both drought and density
   dependence contributed to this decline. Density dependence in survival
   acted on older individuals and its strength doubled after recent
   drought-induced habitat changes. Annual precipitation was a strong
   driver of pup production, but density dependence moderated precipitation
   benefits. Using a stochastic model with island-specific drivers of
   demography, we developed a risk isocline tool to predict 50-yr
   quasi-extinction risk based on population size and mortality. Predicted
   extinction risk for SNI foxes is currently <5\% and expected to
   decrease. Compared to the previously listed subspecies, risk isoclines
   indicate the SNI subspecies is more resistant to quasi-extinction at
   moderate population sizes and mortality rates, but quasi-extinction risk
   does not decline as rapidly at higher population sizes or lower
   mortality rates. Thus, limiting human-caused mortality and monitoring
   for novel threats such as exotic disease remain important. The ability
   of SNI foxes to increase pup production following high-rainfall
   low-density years is a key feature stabilizing their dynamics. Habitat-
   and location-specific dynamics produce substantial portfolio effects,
   whereby asynchrony in growth rates stabilizes overall population
   numbers, and restoration efforts that increase food resources and
   habitat diversity will further enhance the resilience of this
   population. Although the SNI fox appears to be rebounding, its recent
   decline may foreshadow future dynamics and serves as a cautionary tale
   for stewards of island species facing unprecedented climatic conditions,
   especially those inhabiting small and less diverse systems. Finally, our
   analyses highlight limitations in applying risk analyses from one
   population to related species, or even the same species in different
   habitat settings.},

Title = {Climate change may induce connectivity loss and mountaintop extinction
   in Central American forests},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {The tropical forests of Central America serve a pivotal role as
   biodiversity hotspots and provide ecosystem services securing human
   livelihood. However, climate change is expected to affect the species
   composition of forest ecosystems, lead to forest type transitions and
   trigger irrecoverable losses of habitat and biodiversity. Here, we
   investigate potential impacts of climate change on the environmental
   suitability of main plant functional types (PFTs) across Central
   America. Using a large database of occurrence records and physiological
   data, we classify tree species into trait-based groups and project their
   suitability under three representative concentration pathways (RCPs 2.6,
   4.5 and 8.5) with an ensemble of state-of-the-art correlative modelling
   methods. Our results forecast transitions from wet towards generalist or
   dry forest PFTs for large parts of the study region. Moreover, suitable
   area for wet-adapted PFTs is projected to latitudinally diverge and lose
   connectivity, while expected upslope shifts of montane species point to
   high risks of mountaintop extinction. These findings underline the
   urgent need to safeguard the connectivity of habitats through biological
   corridors and extend protected areas in the identified transition
   hotspots. Baumbach et al. investigate impacts of climate change on tree
   species within tropical forest ecosystems in Central America. Their
   models suggest large transitions from wet to generalist or dry species,
   reduced connectivity for wet forest species, and upslope shifts of
   montane species, causing risk of extirpation.},

Volume = {11},

Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {Rare species population dynamics can elucidate the resilience of an
   ecosystem. On coral reefs, climate change and local anthropogenic
   stressors are threatening stony coral persistence, increasing the need
   to assess vulnerable species locally. Here, we monitored the threatened
   pillar coral, Dendrogyra cylindrus, population in southeast Florida,
   USA, in relation to consecutive heat stress events in 2014 and 2015. In
   the fall of each year, D. cylindrus colonies bleached following intense
   thermal stress and by June 2020 all monitored colonies died from a
   white-syndrome type disease. This resulted in the ecological extinction
   of D. cylindrus in the Southeast Florida Coral Reef Ecosystem
   Conservation Area (ECA). White-syndrome type disease was first seen in
   February 2014 on four colonies (19\% prevalence) near the major
   international port, Port Everglades and disease prevalence peaked in
   fall 2015 (58\%). Disease prevalence increased with maximum water
   temperature, while disease related mortality increased with mean water
   temperature. Our findings suggest that thermal stress exacerbated
   underlying stony coral disease, resulting in an outbreak contributing to
   the ecological extirpation of D. cylindrus in the ECA. We suggest that
   stony coral resilience is severely compromised by chronic environmental
   disturbance which hinders community recovery.},

Title = {Assessing the Extinction Risk of Heterocypris incongruens (Crustacea:
   Ostracoda) in Climate Change with Sensitivity and Uncertainty Analysis},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Organisms respond to climate change in many different ways and their
   local extinction risk may vary widely among taxa. Crustaceans from
   freshwater temporary ponds produce resting eggs to cope with
   environmental uncertainty and, as a consequence, egg banks have a
   fundamental role for population persistence. The egg bank dynamics of
   six clonal lineages of Heterocypris incongruens (Ostracoda) from
   Northern Italy were simulated. Clonal lineages W1 and W2 are the most
   common ``winter ecotypes{''}, clonal lineages S1 and S2 are
   allochthonous ``summer ecotypes{''} and clonal lineages I1 and I2 are
   relatively rare and generalist in terms of seasonality. Fecundity and
   proportion of resting eggs vary by clonal lineage, temperature and
   photoperiod. The clonal extinction risk was estimated in present climate
   conditions and under climate change. For comparison, and to assess the
   potential colonization of northern ponds, clonal lineages from Lampedusa
   Island (Southern Italy), L, were considered. Cohen's general model was
   used for simulating egg bank dynamics and the extinction rate of each
   clonal lineage was estimated with uncertainty analysis. A 30 year
   simulation in present and climate change conditions was carried out.
   Extinction rates were lower in climate change conditions than in present
   conditions. Hydroperiod, hatching rate and egg deterioration rate were
   the critical factors that affected extinction rates. Extinction rates
   varied among clonal lineages. This suggests that H. incongruens might be
   able to have multiple responses to climate change due to its genetic
   diversity. In climate change conditions, W clonal lineages underwent a
   niche expansion, while a mismatch between photoperiod and hydroperiod
   might generate a detrimental effect on the phenology of summer S clonal
   lineages that might cause their extinction. Southern clonal lineages L,
   showing an intermediate extinction rate, might colonize northern
   temporary ponds.},

Abstract = {A temperature sensor constructed with tapered two-mode fiber (TTMF)

Title = {Treatment of climate change in extinction risk assessments and recovery
   plans for threatened species},
Journal = {CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The ongoing threat of climate change poses an increasing risk to
   biodiversity, especially for currently threatened species. Climate
   change can both directly impact species and interact with other
   pre-existing threats, such as habitat loss, to further amplify species'
   risk of extinction. Recognizing the threat of climate change in
   extinction risk assessments and recovery planning for imperilled species
   is essential for tailoring and prioritizing recovery actions for
   climate-threatened species. Using species legally listed in Canada we
   show that 44.1\% of species' risk assessments identify the threat of
   climate change, nonetheless, 43.5\% of assessments completely omit
   climate change. Species assessed more recently were more likely to be
   identified as climate-threatened, however, the strength of this
   relationship varied across taxonomic groups. The likelihood that climate
   change was identified as a threat was also strongly affected by the use
   of a standardized threat assessment process. Of the climate-threatened
   species, less than half (46.0\%) of species' recovery plans specified
   actions aimed explicitly at minimizing climate impacts and only 3.8\% of
   recovery plans recommended habitat or population management actions.
   Climate-targeted recovery actions were more likely to be included in
   more recent plans, and were marginally more likely for species where
   climate change was considered a major threat. Our findings highlight the
   urgent need for consistent and standardized assessments of the threat of
   climate change, including the consideration of potential synergies
   between climate change and other existing threats. Performing
   species-specific climate change vulnerability assessments may serve to
   complement existing assessment and recovery planning processes. We
   provide additional recommendations aimed at threatened species recovery
   planners for improving the integration of the threat of climate change
   into species extinction risk assessments and recovery planning processes
   for listed species.},

Abstract = {Accounting for population-level adaptation and migration remains a
   central challenge to predicting climate change effects on biodiversity.
   Assessing how climate change could disrupt local climate adaptation,
   resulting in maladaptation and possibly extirpation, can inform where

   forest tree species balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera), we used
   climate-associated genetic loci to predict population maladaptation with
   and without migration, the distance to sites that minimize
   maladaptation, and the emergence of novel genotype-climate associations.
   We show that the greatest disruptions to contemporary genotype-climate
   associations occur along the longitudinal edges of the range, where
   populations are predicted to be maladapted to all future North American
   climates, rescue via migration is most limited and novel
   genotype-climate associations emerge. Our work advances beyond
   species-level range modelling towards the long-held goal of
   simultaneously estimating the contributions of maladaptation and

Journal = {NATURE ECOLOGY \& EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Assessing extinction risk from climate drivers is a major goal of
   conservation science. Few studies, however, include a long-term
   perspective of climate change. Without explicit integration, such
   long-term temperature trends and their interactions with short-term
   climate change may be so dominant that they blur or even reverse the
   apparent direct relationship between climate change and extinction. Here
   we evaluate how observed genus-level extinctions of arthropods,
   bivalves, cnidarians, echinoderms, foraminifera, gastropods, mammals and
   reptiles in the geological past can be predicted from the interaction of
   long-term temperature trends with short-term climate change. We compare
   synergistic palaeoclimate interaction (a short-term change on top of a
   long-term trend in the same direction) to antagonistic palaeoclimate
   interaction such as long-term cooling followed by short-term warming.
   Synergistic palaeoclimate interaction increases extinction risk by up to
   40\%. The memory of palaeoclimate interaction including the climate
   history experienced by ancestral lineages can be up to 60 Myr long. The
   effect size of palaeoclimate interaction is similar to other key factors
   such as geographic range, abundance or clade membership. Insights
   arising from this previously unknown driver of extinction risk might
   attenuate recent predictions of climate-change-induced biodiversity
   loss.
   Using extinction data from the geological past, the authors compare the
   effects of synergistic palaeoclimate interactions, where short- and
   long-term trends are aligned, with antagonistic ones, where they are
   not, finding that the former can increase extinction risk by up to 40\%.},

Title = {Endemic Juniperus Montane Species Facing Extinction Risk under Climate
   Change in Southwest China: Integrative Approach for Conservation
   Assessment and Prioritization},
Journal = {BIOLOGY-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Simple Summary
   Climate change is one of the most significant drivers of habitat loss
   and species extinction, particularly montane endemic species such as
   Juniper trees, which are restricted to unique habitats. Therefore,
   assessing the impact of climate change on the extinction risk of species
   is a promising tool or guide for species conservation planning. The loss
   in species habitat due to global warming indicates the level of
   extinction or endangerment. Predictions of suitable habitats are outputs
   from assessment analysis. This will help conservationists discover new
   populations of endemic species and help raise the awareness of local
   people to save and rescue these endangered species.
   Climate change is an important driver of biodiversity loss and
   extinction of endemic montane species. In China, three endemic Juniperus
   spp. (Juniperus pingii var. pingii, J. tibetica, and J. komarovii) are
   threatened and subjected to the risk of extinction. This study aimed to
   predict the potential distribution of these three Juniperus species
   under climate change and dispersal scenarios, to identify critical
   drivers explaining their potential distributions, to assess the
   extinction risk by estimating the loss percentage in their area of
   occupancy (AOO), and to identify priority areas for their conservation
   in China. We used ensemble modeling to evaluate the impact of climate
   change and project AOO. Our results revealed that the projected AOOs
   followed a similar trend in the three Juniperus species, which predicted
   an entire loss of their suitable habitats under both climate and
   dispersal scenarios. Temperature annual range and isothermality were the
   most critical key variables explaining the potential distribution of
   these three Juniperus species; they contribute by 16-56.1\% and
   20.4-38.3\%, respectively. Accounting for the use of different
   thresholds provides a balanced approach for species distribution models'
   applications in conservation assessment when the goal is to assess
   potential climatic suitability in new geographical areas. Therefore,
   south Sichuan and north Yunnan could be considered important priority
   conservation areas for in situ conservation and search for unknown
   populations of these three Juniperus species.},

Abstract = {The larvae of some amphibian species grow and develop more slowly at

   first time provided empirical data by using a combination of field and
   lab-based studies with a robust sample size (360 adults, 1000 tadpoles)
   for Hazara Torrent Frog (Allopaa hazarensis) and Murree Hills Frog
   (Nanorana vicina). In this study, we examined how tadpoles responded to
   different temperatures through metamorphosis, body size, developmental
   complications or deformities, fitness and survival. We found that the
   tadpoles of A. hazarensis and N. vicina showed the same response to
   elevated temperatures under laboratory conditions including faster
   metamorphosis, reduction in the body size, more frequent developmental
   complications or deformities such as edema and tail kinks, lower fitness
   and higher mortality at elevated temperatures (>26 degrees C). The
   comparison of thermal sensitivity between the two species showed that N.
   vicina was more sensitive to higher temperatures. Pakistan has been
   experiencing changes in climatic patterns, and the ecosystems in
   northern Pakistan are losing biodiversity due to increasing temperature,
   frequency of drought and intensity of floods. It is feared that these
   frogs may experience local extinction in future. Our findings contribute
   to filling the information gap regarding impacts of temperature increase

Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Achieving policy, business and behaviour change necessary to mitigate
   climate change is one of the most formidable challenges of the
   twenty-first century. Increasingly, researchers have argued that
   communicating purposively designed stories - `strategic narratives' -
   may be effective in building support for the policy measures necessary
   to limit anthropogenic warming to 2 degrees C above pre-industrial
   levels. Recently, following the release of the IPCC's 1.5 degrees C
   special report, novel dynamics have emerged in climate strategic
   communication, with the emergence of new narrators, including youth
   climate strikers, child activist Greta Thunberg, and the insurgent
   group, Extinction Rebellion. Previous literature focuses mostly on
   narrative content and coherence, paying less attention to how a
   narrator's credibility affects climate change strategic narratives'
   persuasiveness. Adopting this broader view, this paper analyses five
   strategic narratives that became prominent in the United Kingdom
   following the IPCC report. Contrary to some previous calls for
   all-encompassing strategic narratives communicated top-down from
   governmental organisations, the most notable strategic narratives in our
   sample emerged from civil society. We therefore call for greater
   attention towards the interaction of different narrators in climate
   change strategic communication, to address whether a broader range of
   narrators constrains or enables coordinated action to mitigate climate
   change.},

   Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary (KPB). Our primary test site is the Elles
   section in Tunisia, the auxiliary Global Stratotype Section and Point
   (GSSP) to El Kef. Elles has the most complete marine sedimentary record
   and a high average sedimentation rate of similar to 4.7 cm/ky. We chose
   the Hor Hahar section in Israel to corroborate the geographic
   distribution of Hg fallout from Deccan volcanism. Reliability of the Hg
   proxy over the last 550 ky of the Maastrichtian to early Danian was
   evaluated based on high-resolution age control (orbital
   cyclostratigraphy), stable isotope climate record, Hg concentrations,
   biotic turnover and mass extinction. These results were correlated with
   the pulsed Deccan eruptive history constrained previously by U-Pb zircon
   geochronology.
   Our results support Hg as robust proxy for Deccan volcanism with large
   Hg spikes marking ``extreme event{''} (EE) pulsed eruptions correlative
   with climate warming peaks separated by steady, less intense eruptions.
   Long-term global climate warming began near similar to 350 ky pre-KPB,
   reached maximum warming (3-4 degrees C) between 285 and 200 ky pre-KPB,
   followed by gradual cooling and rapid temperature drop between 45 and 25
   ky pre-KPB. During the last 25 ky before the KPB, multiple Hg EE
   eruptions correlate with hyperthermal warming that culminated in the
   rapid mass extinction at Elles during <= 1000 years of the Cretaceous.
   These latest Cretaceous Hg peaks may correlate with massive, distal,
   Deccan-sourced lava flows ( > 1000 km long) that traversed the Indian
   subcontinent and flowed into the Bay of Bengal, bracketing the mass
   extinction. These results support Deccan volcanism as a primary driver
   of the end-Cretaceous mass extinction.},

Title = {Projected climate change threatens significant range contraction of
   Cochemiea halei (Cactaceae), an island endemic, serpentine-adapted plant
   species at risk of extinction},

Abstract = {Aim Threats faced by narrowly distributed endemic plant species in the
   face of the Earth's sixth mass extinction and climate change exposure
   are especially severe for taxa on islands. We investigated the current
   and projected distribution and range changes of Cochemiea halei, an
   endemic island cactus. This taxon is of conservation concern, currently
   listed as vulnerable on the International Union for the Conservation of
   Nature Red List and as a species of special concern under Mexican
   federal law. The goals of this study are to (a) identify the
   correlations between climate variables and current suitable habitat for
   C. halei; (b) determine whether the species is a serpentine endemic or
   has a facultative relationship with ultramafic soils; and (c) predict
   range changes of the species based on climate change scenarios.
   Location The island archipelago in Bahia Magdalena on the Pacific coast,
   Baja California Sur, Mexico.
   Methods We used temperature and precipitation variables at 30-arc second
   resolution and soil type, employing multiple species distribution
   modeling methods, to identify important climate and soil conditions
   driving current habitat suitability. The best model of current
   suitability is used to predict possible effects of four climate change
   scenarios based on best-case to worst-case representative concentration
   pathways, with projected climate data from two general circulation
   models, over two time periods.
   Main conclusions The occurrence of the species is found to be strongly
   correlated with ultramafic soils. The most important climate predictor
   for habitat suitability is annual temperature range. The species is
   predicted to undergo range contractions from 21\% to 53\%, depending on
   the severity and duration of exposure to climate change. The broader
   implications for a wide range of narrowly adapted, threatened, and
   endemic plant species indicate an urgent need for threat assessment
   based on habitat suitability and climate change modeling.},

Journal = {DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Number = {2},
Pages = {282-295},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Aim Bogs and transition mires in Central Europe have undergone
   tremendous changes in the last decades, declining in spatial extent and
   favourable conservation status. However, species extinctions have been
   documented only rarely because of a lack of reliable floristic data.
   Here, we assessed species losses of bog complexes and analysed their
   potential drivers.
   Location Black Forest, Germany.
   Methods We made use of the unique situation that the majority of bogs in
   the Black Forest (124 sites) had been systematically surveyed from 1972
   to 1980 and resurveyed the flora of the same sites between 2017 and
   2020. In addition, we included further data from the preceding decades.
   Results Out of 88 species for which we compiled site occupancy data, two
   species went extinct in the whole study area and 37 decreased from 1972
   to 2020, losing on average 33\% of their initial frequency. In contrast,
   46 species displayed a positive trend. While decreasing species were
   characteristic of raised bogs, moorland ponds and base-rich mires,
   increasing species were typical of poor mires, fens and wet meadows.
   Species losses were higher at low elevation, pointing to increasing
   temperature increase and decreasing precipitation as main drivers of
   extinction, while habitat area, distance to the nearest site and land
   use played no significant role. The mean altitude at which extinctions
   of populations occurred increased with time. Assuming a continuation of
   the observed negative trends for declining bog species, our models
   predict the extinction of further ten species by 2045.
   Main Conclusion Our study highlights the value of systematic and
   comprehensive past biodiversity surveys to assess biodiversity change.
   We demonstrated that low-mountain habitats have already suffered
   biodiversity loss as a result of climate change. There are only limited
   management options against rising temperatures and decreasing
   precipitation.},

Volume = {11},

Month = {OCT 22},
Abstract = {Ongoing climate change is predicted to trigger major shifts in the
   geographic distribution of marine plankton species. However, it remains
   unclear whether species will successfully track optimal habitats to new
   regions, or face extinction. Here we show that one significant
   zoo-plankton group, the radiolaria, underwent a severe decline in high
   latitude species richness presaged by ecologic reorganization during the
   late Neogene, a time of amplified polar cooling. We find that the
   majority (71\%) of affected species did not relocate to the warmer low
   latitudes, but went extinct. This indicates that some plankton species
   cannot track optimal temperatures on a global scale as assumed by
   ecologic models; instead, assemblages undergo restructuring and
   extinction once local environmental thresholds are exceeded. This
   pattern forewarns profound diversity loss of high latitude radiolaria in
   the near future, which may have cascading effects on the ocean food web
   and carbon cycle.},

Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT 16},
Abstract = {Climate change seriously threatens biodiversity, particularly in
   mountain ecosystems. However, studies on climate change effects rarely
   consider endemic species and their niche properties. Using species
   distribution models, we assessed the impact of climate change on the
   endemic flora of the richest centre of endemism in the Alps: the
   South-Western Alps. We projected the potential distributions of 100 taxa
   under both an optimistic (RCP2.6) and a pessimistic (RCP8.5) climate
   scenario, analysing the relationships between range dynamics and several
   predictors (dispersal abilities, vegetation belts, niche marginality,
   niche breadth, altitudinal range and present range). The negative impact
   ranged from weak to severe according to the scenario, but the extinction
   risk was low. The dispersal abilities of species strongly affected these
   range dynamics. Colline and subalpine species were the most threatened
   and the relationship between range dynamics and predictors varied among
   vegetation belts. Our results suggest that the rough topography of the
   SW Alps will probably buffer the climate change effects on endemics,
   especially if climate will remain within the limits already experienced
   by species during the Holocene. The presence of the
   Mediterranean-mountain flora, less affected by climate change than the
   alpine one, may explain the lower number of species threatened by
   extinction in the SW Alps than in other European mountains. These
   results suggest that the relationship between plants' sensitivity to
   climate change, and both niche properties and vegetation belts, depends
   on the difference between the current climate in which species grow and
   the future climate, and not just on their niche breadth.},

   mathematical modeling approach},
Journal = {EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {135},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 8},
Abstract = {How species and ecosystems respond to the threatened environmental
   conditions are attracting phenomenon facing ecologists. One can expect
   species fight against these forces to get rid of extinction, i.e.,
   species tend to adapt genetically or move to a new environment to
   resilience against extinction. In this paper, this problem is focused
   theoretically by considering a coupled of the oxygen-plankton model
   where planktons' habitat changes and beachhead as a response to climate
   change. Hence, the dynamics of the oxygen-plankton model is considered
   assuming the spatial gradient of the growth rate of oxygen, in concern
   with altered sea surface temperature. It is observed that there exists a
   relationship between the slope of the gradient and the beachhead at
   which the oxygen-plankton system can stably survive, which can be
   defined by a simple function that separates the areas of extinction and
   persistence. Findings reveal that environmental gradient is an
   alternative way for species to create a new habitat and sustain the
   species persistence. Therefore, in this paper, it is shown that, in
   theory, the recovery of plankton extinction and oxygen depletion under
   climate change can be achieved by adding a spatial gradient.},

Abstract = {A correlation for the prediction of flame lean extinction limits for

   The correlation was developed with the data collected from

   flame stability studies have since appeared in literature and has
   allowed for inspection of the validity of the predictive flame

   correlation is also examined with previous flame blow off studies with
   significant variances of parameters compared to the original study used
   to build the correlation. The data used for comparison differ with fuel
   type, equivalence ratios, pressures, temperatures, turbulence
   intensities, and flameholder geometries. The analysis concludes that the
   predictive flame extinction correlation developed is able to accurately
   predict a wide range of extinction conditions reported in the

   fully capture the behavior of the data for conditions in which

Title = {The role of temperature in the initiation of the end-Triassic mass
   extinction},
Journal = {EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {208},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The end-Triassic mass extinction coincided with the eruption of the
   Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, a large igneous province responsible
   for the massive atmospheric input of potentially climate-altering
   volatile compounds that is associated with a sharp rise in atmospheric
   CO2. The extinction mechanism is debated, but both short-term cooling
   (similar to 10s of years) related to sulfur aerosols and longer-term
   warming (10,000 yrs) related to CO2 emissions-essentially opposite
   hypotheses-are suggested triggers. Until now, no temperature records
   spanning this crucial interval were available to provide a baseline or
   to differentiate between hypothesized mechanisms. Here, we use
   clumped-isotope paleothermometry of shallow marine microbialites coupled
   with climate modeling to reconstruct ocean temperature at the extinction
   horizon. We find mild to warm ocean temperatures during the extinction
   event and evidence for repeated temperature swings of similar to 16
   degrees C, which we interpret as a signature of strong seasonality.
   These results constitute the oldest non-biomineralized marine seasonal
   temperature record. We resolve no apparent evidence for short-term
   cooling or initial warming across the 1-80kyr of the extinction event
   our record captures, implying that the initial onset of the biodiversity
   crisis may necessitate another mechanism.},

Abstract = {A hybrid method based on combining the light-field imaging and laser

   According to the attained absorption coefficient distribution, the

   utilizing the light-field imaging technique. Besides, the influence of
   two types of measured signal noises, i.e. the laser signal noise and the

   investigated thoroughly. The Landweber method is adopted to solve the
   inverse analysis. All the results showed that the 3D temperature and

Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {Background Was there a mid-Cenozoic vertebrate extinction and recovery
   event in Madagascar and, if so, what are its implications for the
   evolution of lemurs? The near lack of an early and mid-Cenozoic fossil
   record on Madagascar has inhibited direct testing of any such
   hypotheses. We compare the terrestrial vertebrate fauna of Madagascar in
   the Holocene to that of early Cenozoic continental Africa to shed light
   on the probability of a major mid-Cenozoic lemur extinction event,
   followed by an ``adaptive radiation{''} or recovery. We also use
   multiple analytic approaches to test competing models of lemur
   diversification and the null hypothesis that no unusual mid-Cenozoic
   extinction of lemurs occurred. Results Comparisons of the terrestrial
   vertebrate faunas of the early Cenozoic on continental Africa and
   Holocene on Madagascar support the inference that Madagascar suffered a
   major mid-Cenozoic extinction event. Evolutionary modeling offers some
   corroboration, although the level of support varies by phylogeny and
   model used. Using the lemur phylogeny and divergence dates generated by
   Kistler and colleagues, RPANDA and TESS offer moderate support for the
   occurrence of unusual extinction at or near the Eocene-Oligocene (E-O)
   boundary (34 Ma). TreePar, operating under the condition of obligate
   mass extinction, found peak diversification at 31 Ma, and low
   probability of survival of prior lineages. Extinction at the E-O
   boundary received greater support than other candidate extinctions or
   the null hypothesis of no major extinction. Using the lemur phylogeny
   and divergence dates generated by Herrera \& Davalos, evidence for
   large-scale extinction diminishes and its most likely timing shifts to
   before 40 Ma, which fails to conform to global expectations. Conclusions
   While support for large-scale mid-Cenozoic lemur extinction on
   Madagascar based on phylogenetic modeling is inconclusive, the African
   fossil record does provide indirect support. Furthermore, a major
   extinction and recovery of lemuriforms during the Eocene-Oligocene
   transition (EOT) would coincide with other major vertebrate extinctions
   in North America, Europe, and Africa. It would suggest that Madagascar's
   lemurs were impacted by the climate shift from ``greenhouse{''} to
   ``ice-house{''} conditions that occurred at that time. This could, in
   turn, help to explain some of the peculiar characteristics of the
   lemuriform clade.},

Abstract = {Climate change affects population cycles of several species, threatening
   biodiversity. However, there are few long-term studies on species with
   conservation issues and restricted distributions. Huemul is a deer
   endemic to the southern Andes in South America and it is considered
   endangered mostly due to a 50\% reduction of its distribution over the
   last 500 years. To assess environmental variables potentially affecting
   huemul population viability and the impact of climate change, we
   developed population dynamics models. We used a 14-year survey data from
   Bernardo O'Higgins National Park, coastal Chilean Patagonia. We used
   Ricker models considering winter and spring temperatures and
   precipitation as variables influencing huemul population dynamics. We
   used the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to select models with the
   greatest predictive power. The two best models (Delta BIC < 2) included
   winter temperature and density-dependence population growth drivers. The
   best model considered a lateral effect, where winter temperature
   influences carrying capacity and the second best a vertical effect with
   winter temperature influencingR(max)and carrying capacity. Population
   viability was evaluated using those models, projecting them over a
   100-year period: (a) under current conditions and (b) under conditions
   estimated by Global Climate Models for 2050 and 2070. The extinction
   risk and quasi-extinction were estimated for this population considering
   two critical huemul abundance levels (15 and 30 individuals) for
   persistence. The population is currently in a quasi-extinction process,
   with extinction probabilities increasing with climate change. These
   results are crucial for conservation of species like huemul that have
   low densities and are threatened by climate change.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Month = {JUL 17},
Abstract = {In recent years, carbon dioxide emissions have been potentiated by
   several anthropogenic processes that culminate in climate change, which
   in turn directly threatens biodiversity and the resilience of natural
   ecosystems. Tropical rainforests are among the most impacted biological
   realms. The Belem endemism center, which is one of the several endemism
   centers in Amazon, is located in the most affected area within the
   so-called ``Deforestation Arc.{''} Moreover, this region harbors a high
   concentration of Amazonian endangered bird species, of which 56\% of
   them are considered to be under the threat of extinction. In this work,
   we sought to evaluate the current and future impacts of both climate
   change and deforestation on the distribution of endemic birds in the
   Belem Area of Endemism (BEA). Thus, we generated species distribution
   models for the 16 endemic bird species considering the current and two
   future gas emission scenarios (optimistic and pessimistic). We also
   evaluated climate change impacts on these birds in three different
   dispersal contexts. Our results indicate that BAE, the endemic taxa will
   lose an average of 73\% of suitable areas by 2050. At least six of these
   birds species will have less than 10\% or no future suitable habitat in
   all emission scenarios. One of the main mechanisms used to mitigate the
   impacts of climate change on these species in the near future is to
   assess the current system of protected areas. It is necessary to ensure
   that these areas will continue being effective in conserving these
   species even under climate change. The ``Gurupi Mosaic{''} and the
   ``Rio-Capim{''} watershed are areas of great importance because they are
   considered climate refuges according to our study. Thus, conservation
   efforts should be directed to the maintenance and preservation of these
   two large remnants of vegetation in addition to creating ecological

Abstract = {Public attention and interest in the fate of endangered species is a
   crucial prerequisite for effective conservation programs. Societal
   awareness and values will largely determine whether conservation
   initiatives receive necessary support and lead to adequate policy
   change. Using text data mining, we assessed general public attention in
   France, Germany and the United Kingdom toward climate change and
   biological invasions in relation to endangered amphibian, reptile, bird
   and mammal species. Our analysis revealed that public attention patterns
   differed among species groups and countries but was globally higher for
   climate change than for biological invasions. Both threats received
   better recognition in threatened than in non-threatened species, as well
   as in native species than in species from other countries and regions.
   We conclude that more efficient communication regarding the threat from
   biological invasions should be developed, and that conservation
   practitioners should take advantage of the existing attention toward
   climate change.},

Journal = {QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {238},

Abstract = {Anatomically Modern Humans are the sole survivor of a group of hominins
   that inhabited our planet during the last ice age and that included,
   among others, Homo neanderthalensis, Homo denisova, and Homo erectus.
   Whether previous hominin extinctions were triggered by external factors,
   such as abrupt climate change, volcanic eruptions or whether competition
   and interbreeding played major roles in their demise still remains
   unresolved. Here I present a spatially resolved numerical hominin
   dispersal model (HDM) with empirically constrained key parameters that
   simulates the migration and interaction of Anatomically Modern Humans
   and Neanderthals in the rapidly varying climatic environment of the last
   ice age. The model simulations document that rapid temperature and
   vegetation changes associated with Dansgaard-Oeschger events were not
   major drivers of global Neanderthal extinction between 50 and 35
   thousand years ago, but played important roles regionally, in particular
   over northern Europe. According to a series of parameter sensitivity
   experiments conducted with the HDM, a realistic extinction of the
   Neanderthal population can only be simulated when Homo sapiens is chosen
   to be considerably more effective in exploiting scarce glacial food
   resources as compared to Neanderthals. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published

Month = {JUN 3},
Abstract = {The Campanian age (Late Cretaceous) is characterized by a warm
   greenhouse climate with limited land-ice volume. This makes this period
   an ideal target for studying climate dynamics during greenhouse periods,
   which are essential for predictions of future climate change due to
   anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Well-preserved fossil shells
   from the Campanian (+/- 78 Ma) high mid-latitude (50 degrees N) coastal
   faunas of the Kristianstad Basin (southern Sweden) offer a unique
   snapshot of short-term climate and environmental variability, which
   complements existing long-term climate reconstructions. In this study,
   we apply a combination of high-resolution spatially resolved trace
   element analyses (micro-X-ray fluorescence - mu XRF - and laser ablation
   inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry - LA-ICP-MS), stable
   isotope analyses (IRMS) and growth modeling to study short-term
   (seasonal) variations recorded in the oyster species Rastellum
   diluvianum from the Ivo Klack locality. Geochemical records through 12
   specimens shed light on the influence of specimen-specific and
   ontogenetic effects on the expression of seasonal variations in shell
   chemistry and allow disentangling vital effects from environmental
   influences in an effort to refine paleoseasonality reconstructions of
   Late Cretaceous greenhouse climates. Growth models based on stable
   oxygen isotope records yield information on the mode of life, circadian
   rhythm and reproductive cycle of these extinct oysters. This multi-proxy
   study reveals that mean annual temperatures in the Campanian higher
   midlatitudes were 17 to 19 degrees C, with winter minima of similar to
   13 degrees C and summer maxima of 26 degrees C, assuming a Late
   Cretaceous seawater oxygen isotope composition of -1 parts per thousand
   VSMOW (Vienna standard mean ocean water). These results yield smaller
   latitudinal differences in temperature seasonality in the Campanian
   compared to today. Latitudinal temperature gradients were similar to the
   present, contrasting with previous notions of ``equable climate{''}
   during the Late Cretaceous. Our results also demonstrate that
   species-specific differences and uncertainties in the composition of
   Late Cretaceous seawater prevent trace element proxies (Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca,
   Mg/Li and Sr/Li) from being used as reliable temperature proxies for
   fossil oyster shells. However, trace element profiles can serve as a
   quick tool for diagenesis screening and investigating seasonal growth
   patterns in ancient shells.},

Abstract = {Large-scale changes in global climate at the end of the Pleistocene
   significantly impacted ecosystems across North America. However, the
   pace and scale of biotic turnover in response to both the Younger Dryas
   cold period and subsequent Holocene rapid warming have been challenging
   to assess because of the scarcity of well dated fossil and pollen
   records that covers this period. Here we present an ancient DNA record
   from Hall's Cave, Texas, that documents 100 vertebrate and 45 plant taxa
   from bulk fossils and sediment. We show that local plant and animal
   diversity dropped markedly during Younger Dryas cooling, but while plant
   diversity recovered in the early Holocene, animal diversity did not.
   Instead, five extant and nine extinct large bodied animals disappeared
   from the region at the end of the Pleistocene. Our findings suggest that
   climate change affected the local ecosystem in Texas over the
   Pleistocene-Holocene boundary, but climate change on its own may not
   explain the disappearance of the megafauna at the end of the
   Pleistocene.},

Journal = {PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Significant reductions in populations of tsetse (Glossina spp) in parts
   of Zimbabwe have been attributed to increases in temperature over recent
   decades. Sustained increases in temperature might lead to local
   extinctions of tsetse populations. Extinction probabilities for tsetse
   populations have not so far been estimated as a function of temperature.
   We develop a time-homogeneous branching process model for situations
   where tsetse live at different levels of fixed temperature. We derive a
   probability distribution p(k)(T) for the number of female offspring an
   adult female tsetse is expected to produce in her lifetime, as a
   function of the fixed temperature at which she is living. We show that
   p(k)(T) can be expressed as a geometric series: its generating function
   is therefore a fractional linear type. We obtain expressions for the
   extinction probability, reproduction number, time to extinction and
   growth rates. The results are valid for all tsetse, but detailed effects
   of temperature will vary between species. No G. m. morsitans population
   can escape extinction if subjected, for extended periods, to
   temperatures outside the range 16 degrees C-32 degrees C. Extinction
   probability increases more rapidly as temperatures approach and exceed
   the upper and lower limits. If the number of females is large enough,
   the population can still survive even at high temperatures (28 degrees
   C-31 degrees C). Small decreases or increases in constant temperature in
   the neighbourhoods of 16 degrees C and 31 degrees C, respectively, can
   drive tsetse populations to extinction. Further study is needed to
   estimate extinction probabilities for tsetse populations in field
   situations where temperatures vary continuously.},

Title = {Climate Change and Green Sea Turtle Sex Ratio-Preventing Possible
   Extinction},
Journal = {GENES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Climate change poses a threat to species with temperature-dependent sex
   determination (TSD). A recent study on green sea turtles (Chelonia
   mydas) at the northern Great Barrier Reef (GBR) showed a highly
   female-skewed sex ratio with almost all juvenile turtles being female.
   This shortage of males might eventually cause population extinction,
   unless rapid evolutionary rescue, migration, range shifts, or
   conservation efforts ensure a sufficient number of males. We built a
   stochastic individual-based model inspired by C. mydas but potentially
   transferrable to other species with TSD. Pivotal temperature, nest
   depth, and shading were evolvable traits. Additionally, we considered
   the effect of crossbreeding between northern and southern GBR, nest site
   philopatry, and conservation efforts. Among the evolvable traits, nest
   depth was the most likely to rescue the population, but even here the
   warmer climate change scenarios led to extinction. We expected turtles
   to choose colder beaches under rising temperatures, but surprisingly,
   nest site philopatry did not improve persistence. Conservation efforts
   promoted population survival and did not preclude trait evolution.
   Although extra information is needed to make reliable predictions for
   the fate of green sea turtles, our results illustrate how evolution can
   shape the fate of long lived, vulnerable species in the face of climate
   change.},

   Background Polarization and Temperature Anisotropy},
Journal = {ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {895},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {We evaluate the degradation of the accuracy of the component separation
   between the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and foreground components
   caused by neglect of absorption of the CMB's monopole component by the
   galactic interstellar matter. The amplitude of the temperature
   anisotropy caused by the CMB shadow, due to dust components, is about 1
   mu K. This value is comparable to the required noise level necessary to
   probe non-Gaussianity studies with upcoming CMB experiments. In
   addition, the amplitude of the polarization caused by the CMB shadow due
   to dust is comparable to or larger than the rms value of the CMB B-mode
   polarization, imprinted by primordial gravitational waves. We show that
   applying a single-power-law model as the dust spectrum to observed
   multifrequency data introduces systematic errors, which are comparable
   to or larger than the required noise level for forthcoming CMB B-mode
   polarization experiments. Deducing the intrinsic spectrum of dust
   emission from the submillimeter wave band data reduces the systematic
   error to below the required noise level. However, this method requires
   dust temperature measurements with an accuracy of better than a few
   percent. We conclude that the CMB shadow due to dust must be considered
   in future CMB missions for achieving their targeted sensitivity. Our
   results will be important to detect the primordial CMB B-mode
   polarization, with the amplitude of the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r =
   10(-3).},

Journal = {QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Stalagmite ANJ94-2 from Anjohibe Cave in northwestern Madagascar
   provides an exceptionally detailed and precisely dated record of
   changing environmental conditions that, combined with previously
   published data from stalagmites, wetland deposits, and archaeological
   sites, allows insights into past climate change, human environmental
   impact, and megafaunal extinction. Proxies of past conditions recovered
   from Stalagmite ANJ94-2 include ratios of carbon and oxygen stable
   isotopes (delta C-13 and delta O-18), mineralogy (calcite and
   aragonite), layer-bounding surfaces, layer-specific width, and detrital
   material. Those proxies suggest that the natural environment changed in
   response to changes in rainfall at time scales of a few decades to
   multiple centuries; comparison with distant proxies suggests that wetter
   conditions in northwestern Madagascar may have been linked to cooling in
   the Northern Hemisphere. Carbon isotope data nonetheless suggest that
   the greatest environmental change in the area coincided with human
   introduction of swidden (tavy) agriculture about 1200 years ago, during
   a time not of drought but perhaps of slightly increasing wetness. The
   timing and extent of environmental change 1200 to 600 years ago seen in
   stalagmite and wetland data suggest that human modification of the
   landscape had a causal role in the extinction of Madagascar's megafauna.
   On the other hand, the results combine with other recent research to
   indicate that drought was not the cause of the megafaunal extinction.

Title = {Climate change-induced migration patterns and extinction risks of

Volume = {10},
Number = {10},
Pages = {4352-4361},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Theaceae, an economically important angiosperm family, is widely
   distributed in tropical and subtropical forests in Asia. In China,
   Theaceae has particularly high abundances and endemism, comprising
   similar to 75\% of the total genera and similar to 46\% of the total
   species worldwide. Therefore, predicting the response of Theaceae
   species to climate change is vital. In this study, we collected
   distribution data for 200 wild Theaceae species in China, and predicted
   their distribution patterns under current and future climactic
   conditions by species distribution modeling (SDM). We revealed that
   Theaceae species richness is highest in southeastern China and on Hainan
   Island, reaching its highest value (137 species) in Fujian Province.
   According to the IUCN Red List criteria for assessing species threat
   levels under two dispersal assumptions (no dispersal and full
   dispersal), we evaluated the conservation status of all Theaceae species
   by calculating loss of suitable habitat under future climate scenarios.
   We predicted that nine additional species will become threatened due to
   climate change in the future; one species will be classified as
   critically endangered (CR), two as endangered (EN), and six as
   vulnerable (VU). Given their extinction risks associated with climate
   change, we recommended that these species be added to the Red List. Our
   investigation of migration patterns revealed regional differences in the
   number of emigrant, immigrant, and persistent species, indicating the
   need for targeted conservation strategies. Regions containing numerous
   emigrants are concentrated in Northern Taiwan and coastal regions of
   Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, while regions containing numerous
   immigrants include central Sichuan Province, the southeastern Tibet
   Autonomous Region, southwest Yunnan Province, northwest Sichuan
   Province, and the junction of Guangxi and Hunan provinces. Lastly,
   regions containing persistent species are widely distributed in southern
   China. Importantly, regions with high species turnover are located on
   the northern border of the entire Theaceae species distribution ranges
   owing to upwards migration; these regions are considered most sensitive
   to climate change and conservation planning should therefore be
   prioritized here. This study will contribute valuable information for
   reducing the negative impacts of climate change on Theaceae species,
   which will ultimately improve biodiversity conservation efficiency.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {108},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1553-1564},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The long-term fate of populations experiencing disequilibrium conditions
   with their environment will ultimately depend on how local colonization
   and extinction dynamics respond to abiotic conditions (e.g. temperature
   and rainfall), dispersal limitation and biotic interactions (e.g.
   competition, facilitation or interactions with natural enemies).
   Understanding how these factors influence distributional dynamics under
   climate change is a major knowledge gap, particularly for small ranged
   and dispersal-limited plant species, which are at higher risk of
   extinction. Epiphytes are hypothesized to be particularly vulnerable to
   climate change and we know little about what drives their distribution
   and how they will respond to climate change. To address this issue, we
   leveraged a 10-year dataset on the occupancy dynamics of the endemic
   orchid Lepanthes rupestris to identify the drivers of local colonization
   and extinction dynamics and assess the long-term fate of this population
   under multiple climate change scenarios.
   We compared 290 dynamic occupancy models in their ability to predict the
   colonization and extinction dynamics of a L. rupestris metapopulation.
   The model set predicted colonization-extinction dynamics as a function
   of asymmetric patch connectivity, moss area, elevation, temperature
   (minimum, maximum and variability) and/or rainfall.
   The best model predicted that local colonization increases with
   increasing asymmetric patch connectivity but decreases as minimum
   temperature and maximum temperature variability increase. The best model
   also predicted that local extinction increases with increasing
   variability in maximum temperature. Negative effects were more severe in
   smaller patches.
   Synthesis. Overall, our results demonstrate the role of asymmetric
   connectivity, climate and interactions with moss area as drivers of
   colonization and extinction dynamics. Moreover, our results suggest that
   asymmetrically dispersed epiphytes may struggle to persist under climate
   change because their limited connectivity may not be enough to
   counterbalance the negative effects of increasing mean or variability in
   temperature.},

Abstract = {Climate change may be a major threat to biodiversity in the next 100
   years. Although there has been important work on mechanisms of decline
   in some species, it generally remains unclear which changes in climate
   actually cause extinctions, and how many species will likely be lost.
   Here, we identify the specific changes in climate that are associated
   with the widespread local extinctions that have already occurred. We
   then use this information to predict the extent of future biodiversity
   loss and to identify which processes may forestall extinction. We used
   data from surveys of 538 plant and animal species over time, 44\% of
   which have already had local extinctions at one or more sites. We found
   that locations with local extinctions had larger and faster changes in
   hottest yearly temperatures than those without. Surprisingly, sites with
   local extinctions had significantly smaller changes in mean annual
   temperatures, despite the widespread use of mean annual temperatures as
   proxies for overall climate change. Based on their past rates of
   dispersal, we estimate that 57-70\% of these 538 species will not
   disperse quickly enough to avoid extinction. However, we show that niche
   shifts appear to be far more important for avoiding extinction than
   dispersal, although most studies focus only on dispersal. Specifically,
   considering both dispersal and niche shifts, we project that only
   16-30\% of these 538 species may go extinct by 2070. Overall, our
   results help identify the specific climatic changes that cause
   extinction and the processes that may help species to survive.},

Abstract = {Habitat transformation and loss is one of the greatest threats currently
   facing avian species. The cumulative impact of climate change on habitat
   loss is projected to produce disproportionate risk for endemic
   high-altitude species. The Southern Bald Ibis (Geronticus calvus) is an
   endemic high-altitude species found throughout highland grassland
   habitats in South Africa and Lesotho. The historical distribution has
   contracted notably and causal factors remain ambiguous. Furthermore, the
   historical population (1950-1970) was believed to be stable, but recent
   local surveys suggest colony declines and the current global population
   status remains largely unquantified. We assessed the current
   distribution and population status of the species through predictive
   modeling and trends in historical and recent colony counts across the
   species' range. We examined climate and habitat change as potential
   causal factors contributing to the historical contraction in
   distribution, and projected the potential impact of future climate
   change predicted by global circulation models. Our study confirms that
   Southern Bald Ibis are of conservation concern. The loss of grasslands
   to expanding woody vegetation through bush encroachment was the most
   detrimental habitat transformation type associated with decreased colony
   growth and colony collapse. We recommend maintaining a minimum threshold
   of 50\% or greater intact grassland habitat surrounding colonies to
   reduce colony extinction risk and promote colony persistence.},

Journal = {MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS},

Abstract = {Synthesis of well-dispersed palladium nanoparticles within silica
   aerogel pores with controlled size was carried out using sol-gel
   synthesis under supercritical ethanol drying. The high concentration of
   silanol groups on silica (SiO2) surface facilitated a superior palladium
   (Pd) loading up to 10 wt \%. The synthesized Pd/Sio(2) nanocomposite
   aerogels were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2
   adsorption-desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
   and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic methods. The silica
   aerogel supported catalysts were found to have a wide pore size
   distribution. TEM investigations confirmed that Pd nanocrystals were
   located within the SiO2 microspores and mesopores. The catalyst was
   evaluated for carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation reaction under
   ignition/extinction conditions. The synthesized catalyst demonstrated a
   high catalytic activity at low operating temperatures (<200 degrees C)
   compared to unsupported Pd nanoparticles or bare SiO2 aerogels. This
   enhancement in CO oxidation activity with Pd/SiO2 aerogel catalysts are
   attributed to the small Pd particles, Pd interaction with the surface of
   the underlying SiO2 and the better dispersion of Pd particles within the
   SiO2 pores. Porosity played a more important role during the extinction
   cycle as a result of the slow dissipation of the heat leading to
   hysteresis. We demonstrate the influence of porosity of catalyst
   supports on the size, dispersion, and catalytic activity of Pd
   nanoparticles.},

Abstract = {The causes of the severest crisis in the history of life around the
   Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) remain controversial. Here we report
   that the latest Permian alluvial plains in Shanxi, North China, went
   through a rapid transition from meandering rivers to braided rivers and
   aeolian systems. Soil carbonate carbon isotope (delta C-13), oxygen
   isotope (delta O-18), and geochemical signatures of weathering intensity
   reveal a consistent pattern of deteriorating environments (cool, arid,
   and anoxic conditions) and climate fluctuations across the PTB. The
   synchronous ecological collapse is confirmed by a dramatic reduction or
   disappearance of dominant plants, tetrapods and invertebrates and a
   bloom of microbially-induced sedimentary structures. A similar rapid
   switch in fluvial style is seen worldwide (e.g. Karoo Basin, Russia,
   Australia) in terrestrial boundary sequences, all of which may be
   considered against a background of global marine regression. The
   synchronous global expansion of alluvial fans and high-energy braided
   streams is a response to abrupt climate change associated with aridity,
   hypoxia, acid rain, and mass wasting. Where neighbouring uplands were
   not uplifting or basins subsiding, alluvial fans are absent, but in
   these areas the climate change is evidenced by the disruption of
   pedogenesis.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {170},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is one of the most important of
   all conservation indicators, but most developing countries do not have
   enough information with which to make assessments. The use of species
   distribution models (SDMs) to predict habitat suitability, both
   currently and in the future under the effects of climate change, offers
   a potential solution for estimating extinction risk. With a set of
   validated observations, we used SDMs to make preliminary evaluations of
   the risk of extinction for 114 Egyptian medicinal plants based on IUCN
   Red-List Criteria and Categories. Using MaxEnt and eleven environmental
   variables, distributions were projected for 2020, 2050, and 2080 under
   two emission scenarios (A2a and B2a) assuming unlimited and no
   dispersal. The IUCN assessments used the predicted distributions as well
   as the actual records to measure both extent of occurrence (EOO) and
   area of occupancy (AOO). There was a positive correlation between EOO
   estimates based on actual records and those based on SDMs, demonstrating
   the ability of SDMs to compensate for a lack of data. Most species could
   be classified as Least Concern (LC) at the current time, whilst in the
   future under climate change, many species face some risk of extinction,
   depending on assumptions. We conclude that it is possible to make
   regional risk assessments even in data-sparse countries, in order to
   plan conservation management in the future. Using species distribution
   modelling together with IUCN Red-List assessment is a good method for
   countries where data are sparse in order to conserve and protect
   threatened species.},

Abstract = {Loss of biological diversity through population extinctions is a global
   phenomenon that threatens many ecosystems. Managers often rely on
   databases of rare species locations to plan land use actions and
   conserve at-risk taxa, so it is crucial that the information they
   contain is accurate and dependable. However, small population sizes,
   long gaps between surveys, and climate change may be leading to
   undetected extinctions of many populations. We used repeated survey
   records for a rare but widespread orchid, Cypripedium fasciculaturn
   (clustered lady's slipper), to model population extinction risk based on
   elevation, population size, and time between observations. Population
   size and elevation were negatively associated with extinction, while
   extinction probability increased with time between observations. We
   interpret population losses at low elevations as a potential signal of
   climate change impacts. We used this model to estimate the probability
   of persistence of populations across California and Oregon, and found
   that 39\%-52\% of the 2415 populations reported in databases from this
   region are likely extinct. Managers should be aware that the number of
   populations of rare species in their databases is potentially an
   overestimate, and consider resurveying these populations to document
   their presence and condition, with priority given to older reports of
   small populations, especially those at low elevations or in other areas

Abstract = {Climate and land-use change, raise significant threats to biodiversity,
   affecting species ranges worldwide. Both factors operate on different
   scales, so including spatial traits that allow them to be appropriately
   evaluated is relevant to the early identification of extinction risks.
   We aimed to evaluate the potential effects of climate and land-use
   change on the extent of suitable habitat of a set of species of Andean
   anurans; to assess the loss of the area of occupancy (AOO); and to
   estimate the risk of extinction according to the percentages of loss of
   the extent of suitable habitat and AOO. We modeled the current and
   future potential distributions of 30 endemic anurans from the Colombian
   Andes. We calculated the change in current potential distributional
   ranges and in the extent of suitable habitat under two climatic regimes
   and land-use scenarios. We quantified the AOO using the 2 x 2 km grid
   method and assessed its loss based on habitat availability in the
   combined scenarios. We used the percentage losses of the extent of
   suitable habitat and AOO to estimate and compare the extinction risks
   according to IUCN criteria. We found that climate and land-use change
   will cause a relative loss of 63.4 \% to 79.4 \% of the current extent
   of suitable habitat and 49.6 \% to 72.6 \% of AOO of the Andean anurans
   by the year 2050. The loss of AOO made it possible to detect twice as
   many species at high risk of extinction than the loss of the extent of
   suitable habitat. The effects of climate change and habitat loss could
   lead to potential extinction events in Andean frogs. Extent of suitable
   habitat, and especially the area of occupancy are appropriate spatial
   traits that could be used to assess extinction risks in species
   sensitive to local habitat modification by climate change and land-use
   change. (C) 2019 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecologica e

Abstract = {Accelerated anthropogenic impacts and climatic changes are widely
   considered to be responsible for unprecedented species extinction.
   However, determining their effects on extinction is challenging owing to
   the lack of long-term data with high spatial and temporal resolution. In
   this study, using historical occurrence records of 11 medium- to
   large-sized mammal species or groups of species in China from 905 BC to
   AD 2006, we quantified the distinctive associations of anthropogenic
   stressors (represented by cropland coverage and human population
   density) and climatic stressors (represented by air temperature) with
   the local extinction of these mammals. We found that both intensified
   human disturbances and extreme climate change were associated with the
   increased local extinction of the study mammals. In the cold phase (the
   premodern period of China), climate cooling was positively associated
   with increased local extinction, while in the warm phase (the modern
   period) global warming was associated with increased local extinction.
   Interactive effects between human disturbance and temperature change
   with the local extinction of elephants, rhinos, pandas, and water deer
   were found. Large-sized mammals, such as elephants, rhinos, and pandas,
   showed earlier and larger population declines than small-sized ones. The
   local extinction sensitivities of these mammals to the human population
   density and standardized temperature were estimated during 1700 to 2000.
   The quantitative evidence for anthropogenic and climatic associations
   with mammalian extinction provided insights into the driving processes
   of species extinction, which has important implications for biodiversity

Title = {Extinction risk of narrowly distributed species of seed plants in Brazil
   due to habitat loss and climate change},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUL 22},
Abstract = {In a world where changes in land cover and climate happen faster than
   ever due to the expansion of human activities, narrowly distributed
   species are predicted to be the first to go extinct. Studies projecting
   species extinction in tropical regions consider either habitat loss or
   climate change as drivers of biodiversity loss but rarely evaluate them
   together. Here, the contribution of these two factors to the extinction
   risk of narrowly distributed species (with ranges smaller than 10,000
   km(2)) of seed plants endemic to a fifth-order watershed in Brazil
   (microendemics) is assessed. We estimated the Regional Climate Change
   Index (RCCI) of these watersheds (areas with microendemics) and
   projected three scenarios of land use up to the year 2100 based on the
   average annual rates of habitat loss in these watersheds from 2000 to
   2014. These scenarios correspond to immediate conservation action
   (scenario 1), long-term conservation action (scenario 2), and no
   conservation action (scenario 3). In each scenario, areas with
   microendemics were classified into four classes: (1) areas with low
   risk, (2) areas threatened by habitat loss, (3) areas threatened by
   climate change, and (4) areas threatened by climate change and habitat
   loss. We found 2,354 microendemic species of seed plants in 776 areas
   that altogether cover 17.5\% of Brazil. Almost 70\% (1,597) of these
   species are projected to be under high extinction risk by the end of the
   century due to habitat loss, climate change, or both, assuming that
   these areas will not lose habitat in the future due to land use.
   However, if habitat loss in these areas continues at the prevailing
   annual rates, the number of threatened species is projected to increase
   to more than 85\% (2,054). The importance of climate change and habitat
   loss as drivers of species extinction varies across phytogeographic
   domains, and this variation requires the adoption of retrospective and
   prospective conservation strategies that are context specific. We
   suggest that tropical countries, such as Brazil, should integrate
   biodiversity conservation and climate change policies (both mitigation
   and adaptation) to achieve win-win social and environmental gains while
   halting species extinction.},

Abstract = {Cave bears (Ursus spelaeus) are an iconic component of the European late
   Quaternary Ice Age megafauna. Recent demographic analyses based on cave
   bear mtDNA sequences and refined radiocarbon dating indicate that cave
   bear population size and genetic diversity started to decline some 50
   kilo years ago (kya). Hence, neither the coldest phase of the last
   glaciation (started some 24 kya), nor the colonization of Europe by
   Palaeolithic hunters (started some 45 kya) coincides with the beginning
   of population decline. Here, we reconstructed cave bear climatic niche
   evolution through time. Then, we performed spatially explicit population
   viability analyses to assess cave bear demographics through time in
   response to climatic changes, human effects on bear survival and their
   combination. We found that climate change was responsible for a 10-fold
   decrease in cave bear population size after 40 kya. However, climate
   change on its own could not explain U.spelaeus extinction at 24 kya.
   Additional negative effects consistent with human population expansion
   are required to explain both U.spelaeus' retreat from eastern Europe
   since 40 kya and its final extinction.},

Abstract = {Even though different optical techniques have been applied on `Spray A'
   in-flame soot quantification within Engine Combustion Network in recent
   years, little information can be found for soot temperature measurement.
   In this study, a combined extinction and radiation methodology has been
   developed with different wavelengths and applied on quasi-steady Diesel
   flame to obtain the soot amount and temperature distribution
   simultaneously by considering self-absorption issues. All the
   measurements were conducted in a constant pressure combustion chamber.
   The fuel as well as the operating conditions and the injector used were
   chosen following the guidelines of the Engine Combustion Network.
   Uncertainty caused by wavelength selection was evaluated. Additionally,
   temperature-equivalence ratio maps were constructed by combining the
   measurements with a 1D spray model.
   Temperature fields during the quasi-steady combustion phase show peak
   temperatures around the limit of the radiation field, in agreement with
   a typical diffusion flame structure. Effects of different operating
   parameters on soot formation and temperature were investigated. Soot
   temperature increases dramatically with oxygen concentration, but it
   shows much less sensitivity with ambient temperature and injection
   pressure, which on the other hand have significant effects on soot
   production. (C) 2019 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {Our knowledge of active magmatic hydrothermal system (or magmatic
   vapors) is largely related to the modeling of geochemical processes
   including heterogeneous equilibrium calculations with variable bulk
   composition, temperature or pressure. With the aim to constrain the
   characteristics of extinct hydrothermal systems it is necessary to look
   for petrogenic evidence in active ones. The Kudryavy volcano in the
   Kurile Islands (Russia) provides a unique natural laboratory to study
   the formation of fumarolic rocks from high temperature fluids (measured
   temperature for the fumaroles up to 940 degrees C). By studying the
   minerals chemistry and assemblages and by computing a thermodynamical
   modeling, we investigated the mineralogical evidence for such
   high-temperature. We confirm the documented occurrence of Ca-Fe rich
   minerals as isolated patches, veins or incrustation in cavities and
   their formation during the alteration of primary minerals. We describe
   and documented secondary Na-Al rich minerals (davyne, nepheline,
   sodalite) and their occurrence together with Ca-Fe minerals in cavities.
   We also documented the presence of Fe-wollastonite, a relatively rare
   mineral suggesting high-T formation and we observed assemblages
   including wollastonite + andradite + magnetite suggesting
   high-temperature decomposition of andradite. This natural laboratory
   provides a series of concordant petrologic evidences for
   high-temperature fumarolic rocks and offers guidelines for the study of
   ancient high temperature hydrothermal environments on Earth and other

Volume = {28},

Abstract = {Around the world, many species are confined to ``Sky Islands,{''} with
   different populations in isolated patches of montane habitat. How does
   this pattern arise? One scenario is that montane species were widespread
   in lowlands when climates were cooler, and were isolated by local
   extinction caused by warming conditions. This scenario implies that many
   montane species may be highly susceptible to anthropogenic warming.
   Here, we test this scenario in a montane lizard (Sceloporus jarrovii)
   from the Madrean Sky Islands of southeastern Arizona. We combined data
   from field surveys, climate, population genomics, and physiology.
   Overall, our results support the hypothesis that this species' current
   distribution is explained by local extinction caused by past climate
   change. However, our results for this species differ from simple
   expectations in several ways: (a) their absence at lower elevations is
   related to warm winter temperatures, not hot summer temperatures; (b)
   they appear to exclude a low-elevation congener from higher elevations,
   not the converse; (c) they are apparently absent from many climatically
   suitable but low mountain ranges, seemingly ``pushed off the top{''} by
   climates even warmer than those today; (d) despite the potential for
   dispersal among ranges during recent glacial periods (similar to 18,000
   years ago), populations in different ranges diverged similar to 4.5-0.5
   million years ago and remained largely distinct; and (e) body
   temperatures are inversely related to climatic temperatures among sites.
   These results may have implications for many other Sky Island systems.
   More broadly, we suggest that Sky Island species may be relevant for
   predicting responses to future warming.},

Title = {Extinction risks of a Mediterranean neo-endemism complex of mountain
   vipers triggered by climate change},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {APR 19},
Abstract = {Climate change is among the most important drivers of biodiversity
   decline through shift or shrinkage in suitable habitat of species.
   Mountain vipers of the genus Montivipera are under extreme risk from
   climate changes given their evolutionary history and geographic
   distribution. In this study, we divided all Montivipera species into
   three phylogenetic-geographic Montivipera clades (PGMC; Bornmuelleri,
   Raddei and Xanthina) and applied an ensemble ecological niche modelling
   (ENM) approach under different climatic scenarios to assess changes in
   projected suitable habitats of these species. Based on the predicted
   range losses, we assessed the projected extinction risk of the species
   relative to IUCN Red List Criteria. Our result revealed a strong decline
   in suitable habitats for all PGMCs (63.8\%, 79.3\% and 96.8\% for
   Xanthina, Raddei and Bornmuelleri, respectively, by 2070 and under 8.5
   RCP scenario) with patterns of altitudinal range shifts in response to
   projected climate change. We found that the mountains close to the
   Mediterranean Sea are exposed to the highest threats in the future (84.6
   +/- 9.1 percent range loss). We also revealed that disjunct populations
   of Montivipera will be additionally highly isolated and fragmented in
   the future. We argue that leveraging climate niche projections into the
   risk assessment provides the opportunity to implement IUCN criteria and
   better assess forthcoming extinction risks of species.},

Journal = {QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {210},
Pages = {136-153},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Stalagmite data from Anjohibe Cave in northwest Madagascar suggest six
   distinct climate periods from 9.1 to 0.94 ka. Periods I and II (9.1-4.9
   ka) were wetter and punctuated by a series of prominent droughts.
   Periods IV-VI (4-0.94 ka) were much drier and less variable. Period III
   (4.9-4 ka) marks the transition between wetter and drier conditions and
   consists of two significant droughts: the first (4.8-4.6 ka) coincides
   approximately with the end of the African Humid Period and the second
   (43-4.0 ka) may be the expression of the Northern Hemisphere 4.2 ka dry
   event in northwest Madagascar. Strong positive correlations between
   delta C-13 and delta O-18 values in Periods I-IV (r = 0.63-0.91) suggest
   that both isotopes were influenced by natural climate changes indicating
   that humans may not have been present in the area. In contrast, during
   Periods V (r = 0.07) and VI (r = -0.12) the ``decoupling{''} of delta
   C-13 and delta O-18 might signal an impact from human activities
   starting around 2.5 ka. Rapid changes in climate during the early and
   middle Holocene, with prominent droughts lasting up to 800 years, did
   not kill off Madagascar's megafauna, and neither did a human population,
   present since the early Holocene if evidence from south Madagascar is
   reliable. However, many extinctions occurred under the more stable
   climatic conditions of the late Holocene, despite an antiphase climate
   relationship between northern and southcentral Madagascar. This suggests
   that initial human colonization, or significant increase in human
   population, triggered the megafaunal extinctions by hunting and
   destruction of megafaunal habitats. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The Younger Dryas (YD) impact hypothesis posits that fragments of a
   large, disintegrating asteroid/ comet struck North America, South
   America, Europe, and western Asia -12,800 years ago. Multiple
   airbursts/impacts produced theYD boundary layer (YDB), depositing peak
   concentrations of platinum, high-temperature spherules, meltglass, and
   nanodiamonds, forming an isochronous datum at >50 sites across similar
   to 50 million km(2)of Earth's surface. This proposed event triggered
   extensive biomass burning, brief impact winter, YD climate change, and
   contributed to extinctions of late Pleistocene megafauna. In the most
   extensive investigation south of the equator, we report on a similar to
   12,800-year-old sequence at Pilauco, Chile (similar to 40 degrees S),
   that exhibits peak YD boundary concentrations of platinum, gold,
   high-temperature iron- and chromium-rich spherules, and native iron
   particles rarely found in nature. A major peak in charcoal abundance
   marks an intense biomass-burning episode, synchronous with dramatic
   changes in vegetation, including a high-disturbance regime, seasonality
   in precipitation, and warmer conditions. This is anti-phased with
   northern-hemispheric cooling at the YD onset, whose rapidity suggests
   atmospheric linkage. The sudden disappearance of megafaunal remains and
   dung fungi in the YDB layer at Pilauco correlates with megafaunal
   extinctions across the Americas. The Pilauco record appears consistent
   with YDB impact evidence found at sites on four continents.},

   profoundly influences the extinction risk assessment for wild Arabica
   coffee},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {25},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Arabica coffee (Coffea arabica) is a key crop in many tropical countries
   and globally provides an export value of over US\$13 billion per year.
   Wild Arabica coffee is of fundamental importance for the global coffee
   sector and of direct importance within Ethiopia, as a source of
   harvestable income and planting stock. Published studies show that
   climate change is projected to have a substantial negative influence on
   the current suitable growing areas for indigenous Arabica in Ethiopia
   and South Sudan. Here we use all available future projections for the
   species based on multiple general circulation models (GCMs), emission
   scenarios, and migration scenarios, to predict changes in Extent of
   Occurrence (EOO), Area of Occupancy (AOO), and population numbers for
   wild Arabica coffee. Under climate change our results show that
   population numbers could reduce by 50\% or more (with a few models
   showing over 80\%) by 2088. EOO and AOO are projected to decline by
   around 30\% in many cases. Furthermore, present-day models compared to
   the near future (2038), show a reduction for EOO of over 40\% (with a
   few cases over 50\%), although EOO should be treated with caution due to
   its sensitivity to outlying occurrences. When applying these metrics to
   extinction risk, we show that the determination of generation length is
   critical. When applying the International Union for Conservation of
   Nature's Red list of Threatened Species (IUCN Red List) criteria, even
   with a very conservative generation length of 21 years, wild Arabica
   coffee is assessed as Threatened with extinction (placed in the
   Endangered category) under a broad range of climate change projections,
   if no interventions are made. Importantly, if we do not include climate
   change in our assessment, Arabica coffee is assessed as Least Concern
   (not threatened) when applying the IUCN Red List criteria.},

Abstract = {Geologically rapid climate change is anticipated to increase extinction
   risk nonuniformly across the Earth's surface. Tropical species may be
   more vulnerable than temperate species to current climate warming
   because of high tropical climate velocities and reduced seawater oxygen
   levels. To test whether rapid warming indeed preferentially increased
   the extinction risk of tropical fossil taxa, we combine a robust
   statistical assessment of latitudinal extinction selectivity (LES) with
   the dominant views on climate change occurring at ancient extinction
   crises. Using a global data set of marine fossil occurrences, we assess
   extinction rates for tropical and temperate genera, applying log ratios
   to assess effect size and Akaike weights for model support. Among the
   classical ``big five{''} mass extinction episodes, the end-Permian mass
   extinction exhibits temperate preference of extinctions, whereas the
   Late Devonian and end-Triassic selectively hit tropical genera. Simple
   links between the inferred direction of climate change and LES are
   idiosyncratic, both during crisis and background intervals. More complex
   models, including sampling patterns and changes in the latitudinal
   distribution of continental shelf area, show tropical LES to be
   generally associated with raised tropical heat and temperate LES with
   global cold temperatures. With implications for the future, our paper
   demonstrates the consistency of high tropical temperatures, habitat
   loss, and the capacity of both to interact in generating geographic
   patterns in extinctions.},

Abstract = {Extinction and delayed recovery during the end-Permian extinction and
   Early Triassic has been linked to environmental instability brought on
   by volcanic outgassing and greenhouse conditions, but the relative
   importance of the myriad of environmental stressors at this time on
   recovery dynamics is not well understood. Previous workers have
   documented both overall delayed biotic recovery for the entirety of the
   Early Triassic, but also incipient recoveries that appear to occur
   relatively early after the initial extinction event. Here, we explore
   the patterns of extinction and recovery using several metrics of
   ecological complexity in marine benthic communities using a global
   dataset, and compare several multiple regression models to determine
   which set of abiotic factors best predicts extinction and recovery
   dynamics. We additionally test the importance of temporal scale of
   analysis in interpretations of recovery dynamics and modeling results,
   by including analyses at the epoch, stage, and substage scales
   bracketing the interval of extinction and recovery. We find differences
   in mode of recovery between the ecological metrics analyzed, with some
   metrics exhibiting an Early Triassic recovery lag, while others recover
   continuously or immediately following the initial extinction event. We
   also find evidence of a global `Dienerian minimum', with overall levels
   of community complexity significantly lower than earlier Griesbachian
   communities, suggesting a synchronous disturbance to the progression of
   recovery at this time. The regression model with delta O-18(apotite)
   mean values as the response variable is most often found to be the
   best-fit model across all time scales analyzed, though proxies of rock
   record fidelity and aleontological sampling effort become more important
   in finer timescale analyses, likely due to dwindling sample numbers. Out
   of the models tested, these results suggest that global ocean
   temperatures best predict patterns of extinction and recovery across
   several ecological metrics, and that thermal episodes during the initial
   extinction event and subsequently in the Early Triassic recovery period
   significantly suppressed benthic marine community health.},

   million years ago) is the hypothesized trigger for the largest mass
   extinction in Earth's history. We present model simulations of the
   Permian/Triassic climate transition that reproduce the ocean warming and
   oxygen (O-2) loss indicated by the geologic record. The effect of these
   changes on animal survival is evaluated using the Metabolic Index (Phi),
   a measure of scope for aerobic activity governed by organismal traits
   sampled in diverse modern species. Modeled loss of aerobic habitat
   predicts lower extinction intensity in the tropics, a pattern confirmed
   with a spatially explicit analysis of the marine fossil record. The
   combined physiological stresses of ocean warming and O-2 loss can

Abstract = {We performed a comprehensive laser absorption/extinction study of
   temperature and soot volume fraction (SVF) in C2H4/air premixed sooting
   flames. Laser-absorption two-line thermometry at 2.5 mu m provided a
   temperature uncertainty of 50 K compared with that of 90 K using
   conventional thermocouples. Laser extinction of soot at 633 nm was first
   validated against the previous measurements using laser-induced
   incandescence. All of the measurements were conducted at four
   representative C2H4 flame conditions (equivalence ratio Phi = 1.78,
   1.95, 2.14, and 2.38). In addition, a CFD (computational fluid dynamics)
   framework coupling a skeletal mechanism (56 species and 428 reactions)
   with the Moss-Brookes model was developed for interpreting the
   experimental data. The current CFD simulations well predicted the
   temperature and SVF distribution along the centerline of flame. It is of
   interest to observe that the SVF depends on the Reynolds number of
   reactants by investigating the SVFs at different heights above the

   findings support projections that warming will likely drive widespread
   extirpations and extinctions of high-elevation taxa in the tropical
   Andes. Such climate change-driven mountaintop extirpations may be more
   likely in the tropics, where temperature seems to exert a stronger
   control on species' range limits than in the temperate zone. In

   expanding in range size as they shift their upper limits upslope and may

Abstract = {Why do species exist some places but not others? This question arguably
   lies at the core of ecology and evolutionary biology, and a number of
   hypotheses have been put forward to explain the remarkable diversity in
   geographic range and distribution among species. The niche breadth
   hypothesis - that evolved increases in environmental tolerance permit
   larger geographic ranges than species with more narrow tolerances - is
   generally well-supported (Slatyer et al. 2013), but there are a number
   of limitations on how environmental tolerances are assessed and the
   spatial and taxonomic replication of these data. The question of whether
   there exist broad-scale taxonomic and geographic relationships between
   tolerance breadth and range size has become increasingly salient as the
   world experiences rapid changes in climate. Small-ranged species are
   frequently more prone to extinction under environmental perturbation
   (Purvis et al. 2000), and as a consequence may be more vulnerable to
   global climate change. Comparisons of tolerance breadth and range size
   can therefore yield important biological insights into the determinants
   of species ranges and their vulnerability to climate change. We
   developed a global dataset of ant thermal tolerances and geographic
   range size and latitudinal position and found that species with narrow
   thermal tolerance breadths had restricted, more equatorially positioned
   geographic ranges, suggesting tropical thermal specialists are at
   greater risk of extinction under climate change.},

Abstract = {The rising increase in groundwater abstraction to serve the industrial
   sector and to fulfill the agricultural and domestic needs, coupled with
   severe drought periods during the past decades, leads to a growing
   deficit of water. The drawdown of piezometric levels and progressing
   degradation of water quality are the main consequences of such intensive
   exploitation. In this connection, the present study emphasizes the major
   effects of groundwater resource overexploitation in Southern Tunisia,
   and it evaluates its impacts on the ancient mkayel ``Foggara{''} system.
   Although it is crucial role in various aspects of modern society,
   especially in Gafsa basin ({''}El Guettar region{''}, central of
   Tunisia), this system is facing an increasing abandonment with the
   introduction of new technologies in response to the irrational
   exploitation. The mkayel are particularly susceptible to impairment by
   groundwater withdrawals with modern wells and pumps. In arid regions,
   the proper conservation and maintenance of the mkayel systems constitute
   promising alternatives for sustainable water management and for
   supporting economic development. In the past few decades, we witness a
   gradual disappearance of these galleries by an average loss of a dozen
   of mkayels per year for over half of a century expressed by a
   significant drop in the discharge of the 800 functional mkayels, enough
   to irrigate 450 ha, from 1000 l/s in 1900, 200 l/s in 1960, and 5 l/s in
   1975 to 0 l/s in 2011 related to technical, social, and environmental
   causes. Despite the continuous extinction of mkayels, many Arabic
   countries still consider it as an important system of water transfer.},

Abstract = {The understanding of thermal and chemical effects of water addition to

   of emissions. In this work, the role of water is evaluated by adding
   water vapor to the fuel side of a steady non-premixed coflow flame. The
   steady nature of the flame allows temperature profiles and extinction
   limits to be measured at different conditions of inlet fuel velocities,
   and with increasing dilution levels up to extinction. Temperatures are
   measured by thin-filament pyrometry (TFP) using a SiC fiber and a
   commercial DSLR camera. Results from Ar, N-2 or CO2 diluted flames are
   also reported to compare the effects of water vapor with those of
   different diluents. Comparisons in terms of temperatures and extinction
   limits show close correspondence when adding equivalent levels of
   diluent thermal capacitance.},

Abstract = {Climate forcing, which is blamed for the decennial decline in the
   dynamics of vole populations in Central and Northern Europe, may have
   similar effects in southern (Mediterranean) Europe, even more so since
   the region is especially vulnerable to global change. In the absence of
   population monitoring, we investigated the temporal development and
   geospatial pattern of the habitat of Harting's vole (Microtus hartingi)
   in southeast Europe (SEE) by relying on data regarding its presence, the
   most recent freely available geospatial datasets and state-of-the-art
   presence-only Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) techniques. Results
   indicate that (1) the potential habitat of Harting's vole was perhaps
   stable over the last 6000 years - modelling predictions are in
   conjunction with scarce fossil evidence, which points to repeated
   colonisations from Asia Minor punctuated by extinctions in SEE; (2)
   fragmentation of the potential habitat in SEE, which may have already
   begun in the Last Glacial Maximum, and will most likely continue in the
   near future; and (3) Harting's vole could disappear by the end of the
   century if more pessimistic climate change scenarios become reality.
   While climate change is suppressing the population dynamics of the
   keystone grass-eating voles from temperate and boreal ecosystems, it is
   about to annihilate their Mediterranean counterpart. This will result in
   a far more severe impact on community restructuring in the Mediterranean
   ecosystems than elsewhere. Long-term population monitoring is
   desperately needed in SEE to hone the ability to more accurately predict
   the impacts of climate change.},

Abstract = {Predators are critical components of ecosystems, but large marsupial
   carnivores have suffered major declines and extinctions in Australia. To
   inform predator restoration efforts on Kangaroo Island (South Australia)
   we examined the survival histories and potential extirpation factors of
   large marsupial carnivores that previously occurred on Kangaroo Island,
   King Island and Flinders Island, located off the southern coastline of
   the Australian mainland. Through a review of historical accounts and
   fossil evidence, we determined that the pattern of species persistence
   and extirpation on Kangaroo Island parallels that observed on King and
   Flinders Islands. Fossil data supports the terminal Pleistocene-early
   Holocene extinction of the thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus) from
   Kangaroo Island and the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) from both
   Kangaroo and Flinders Islands. Though eastern quoll (Dasyurus
   viverrinus) fossils have been found on both Kangaroo and Flinders
   Islands, and western quoll (D. geoffroii) on Kangaroo Island,
   contemporary evidence for their post-European persistence is unclear. In
   contrast, fossil, museum and anecdotal data supports the presence of the
   spotted-tailed quoll (D. maculatus) on all three islands and, contrary
   to established knowledge, its post-European persistence on Kangaroo
   Island. The loss of T. cynocephalus, S. harrisii, D. geoffroii and D.
   viverrinus from these islands appears to be commensurate with late to
   terminal Pleistocene-early Holocene climate change and associated
   changes in vegetation communities. In contrast, anthropogenic
   persecution of D. maculatus appears to be the principal cause of its
   post-European extirpation. We recommend D. maculatus as a suitable
   candidate marsupial carnivore for reintroduction to Kangaroo Island.},

Abstract = {Protecting biodiversity against the impacts of climate change requires
   effective conservation strategies that safeguard species at risk of
   extinction(1). Microrefugia allowed populations to survive adverse
   climatic conditions in the past(2,3), but their potential to reduce
   extinction risk from anthropogenic warming is poorly understood(3-5),
   hindering our capacity to develop robust in situ measures to adapt
   conservation to climate change(6). Here, we show that microclimatic
   heterogeneity has strongly buffered species against regional
   extirpations linked to recent climate change. Using more than five
   million distribution records for 430 climate-threatened and
   range-declining species, population losses across England are found to
   be reduced in areas where topography generated greater variation in the
   microclimate. The buffering effect of topographic microclimates was
   strongest for those species adversely affected by warming and in areas
   that experienced the highest levels of warming: in such conditions,
   extirpation risk was reduced by 22\% for plants and by 9\% for insects.
   Our results indicate the critical role of topographic variation in
   creating microrefugia, and provide empirical evidence that microclimatic
   heterogeneity can substantially reduce extinction risk from climate

Volume = {24},

Abstract = {Land-cover and climate change are two main drivers of changes in species
   ranges. Yet, the majority of studies investigating the impacts of global
   change on biodiversity focus on one global change driver and usually use
   simulations to project biodiversity responses to future conditions. We
   conduct an empirical test of the relative and combined effects of
   land-cover and climate change on species occurrence changes.
   Specifically, we examine whether observed local colonization and
   extinctions of North American birds between 1981-1985 and 2001-2005 are
   correlated with land-cover and climate change and whether bird life
   history and ecological traits explain interspecific variation in
   observed occurrence changes. We fit logistic regression models to test
   the impact of physical land-cover change, changes in net primary
   productivity, winter precipitation, mean summer temperature, and mean
   winter temperature on the probability of Ontario breeding bird local
   colonization and extinction. Models with climate change, land-cover
   change, and the combination of these two drivers were the top ranked
   models of local colonization for 30\%, 27\%, and 29\% of species,
   respectively. Conversely, models with climate change, land-cover change,
   and the combination of these two drivers were the top ranked models of
   local extinction for 61\%, 7\%, and 9\% of species, respectively. The
   quantitative impacts of land-cover and climate change variables also
   vary among bird species. We then fit linear regression models to test
   whether the variation in regional colonization and extinction rate could
   be explained by mean body mass, migratory strategy, and habitat
   preference of birds. Overall, species traits were weakly correlated with
   heterogeneity in species occurrence changes. We provide empirical
   evidence showing that land-cover change, climate change, and the
   combination of multiple global change drivers can differentially explain
   observed species local colonization and extinction.},

Abstract = {Pathogens are a significant component of all plant communities. In
   recent years, the potential for existing and emerging pathogens of
   agricultural crops to cause increased yield losses as a consequence of
   changing climatic patterns has raised considerable concern. In contrast,
   the response of naturally occurring, endemic pathogens to a warming
   climate has received little attention. Here, we report on the impact of
   a signature variable of global climate change - increasing temperature -
   on the long-term epidemiology of a natural host-pathogen association
   involving the rust pathogen Triphragmium ulmariae and its host plant
   Filipendula ulmaria. In a host-pathogen metapopulation involving
   approximately 230 host populations growing on an archipelago of islands
   in the Gulf of Bothnia we assessed changes in host population size and
   pathogen epidemiological measures over a 25-year period. We show how the
   incidence of disease and its severity declines over that period and most
   importantly demonstrate a positive association between a long-term trend
   of increasing extinction rates in individual pathogen populations of the
   metapopulation and increasing temperature. Our results are highly
   suggestive that changing climatic patterns, particularly mean monthly
   growing season (April-November) temperature, are markedly influencing
   the epidemiology of plant disease in this host-pathogen association.
   Given the important role plant pathogens have in shaping the structure
   of communities, changes in the epidemiology of pathogens have
   potentially far-reaching impacts on ecological and evolutionary
   processes. For these reasons, it is essential to increase understanding
   of pathogen epidemiology, its response to warming, and to invoke these
   responses in forecasts for the future.},

Abstract = {Climate change can have significant impacts on the survival of plant
   species. However, it is seldom included in the assessment of the
   extinction risk according to IUCN Red List criteria. Lack of data and
   uncertainties of predictions make difficult such inclusion. In our paper
   we present an approach, in which the effect of climate change on plant
   species spatial distribution is used to prioritize conservation within
   IUCN categories. We used, as a case study, 37 Italian policy species,
   relevant for conservation, and listed in the Habitat Directive and Bern
   Convention, and for which a Red List (RL) assessment was available. A
   stochastic SDM incorporating data on plant dispersal, generation length,
   and habitat fragmentation was used to predict a range shift due to
   climate change according to two climatic scenarios (RCP 2.6 and 8.5). No
   species was predicted to become extinct in the considered timespans
   (2050 and 2070) due to climate change, and only two were characterized
   by critical decline probabilities. However, all taxa were potentially
   affected by climate change through a reduction of their range. In all RL
   categories, species with the highest predicted reduction of range were
   those from lowlands, where fragmentation of natural habitats has
   occurred in the last decades. In these cases, despite some limitations,
   assisted migration can be considered a suitable conservation option.},

Title = {Climate change-driven extinctions of tree species affect forest
   functioning more than random extinctions},
Journal = {DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},
Number = {7},
Pages = {906-918},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Aim: Climate change affects forest functioning not only through direct
   physiological effects such as modifying photosynthesis and growing
   season lengths, but also through indirect effects on community
   composition related to species extinctions and colonizations. Such
   indirect effects remain poorly explored in comparison with the direct
   ones. Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) studies commonly examine
   the effects of species loss by eliminating species randomly. However,
   species extinctions caused by climate change will depend on the species'
   vulnerability to the new environmental conditions, thus occurring in a
   specific, non-random order. Here, we evaluated whether successive tree
   species extinctions, according to their vulnerability to climate change,
   impact forest functions differently than random species losses.
   Location: Eleven temperate forests across a gradient of climatic
   conditions in central Europe.
   Methods: We simulated tree community dynamics with a forest succession
   model to study the impact of species loss on the communities'
   aboveground biomass, productivity and temporal stability. Tree species
   were removed from the local pool (1) randomly, and according to (2)
   their inability to be recruited under a warmer climate or (3) their
   increased mortality under drier conditions.
   Results: Results showed that non-random species loss (i.e., based on
   their vulnerability to warmer or drier conditions) changed forest
   functioning at a different rate, and sometimes direction, than random
   species loss. Furthermore, directed extinctions, unlike random,
   triggered tipping points along the species loss process where forest
   functions were strongly impacted. These tipping points occurred after
   fewer extinctions in forests located in the coldest areas, where
   ecosystem functioning relies on fewer species.
   Main conclusions: We showed that the extinction of species in a
   deterministic and mechanistically motivated order, in this case the
   species vulnerability to climate change, strengthens the selection
   effect of diversity on ecosystem functioning. BEF studies exploring the
   impact of species loss on ecosystem functioning using random extinctions
   thus possibly underestimate the potential effect of biodiversity loss
   when driven by a directional force, such as climate change.},

Title = {Plasticity reveals hidden resistance to extinction under climate change
   in the global hotspot of salamander diversity},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {4},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Extinction rates are predicted to rise exponentially under climate
   warming, but many of these predictions ignore physiological and
   behavioral plasticity that might buffer species from extinction. We
   evaluated the potential for physiological acclimatization and behavioral
   avoidance of poor climatic conditions to lower extinction risk under
   climate change in the global hotspot of salamander diversity, a region
   currently predicted to lose most of the salamander habitat due to
   warming. Our approach integrated experimental physiology and behavior
   into a mechanistic species distribution model to predict extinction risk
   based on an individual's capacity to maintain energy balance with and
   without plasticity. We assessed the sensitivity of extinction risk to
   body size, behavioral strategies, limitations on energy intake, and
   physiological acclimatization of water loss and metabolic rate. The
   field and laboratory experiments indicated that salamanders readily
   acclimatize water loss rates and metabolic rates in ways that could
   maintain positive energy balance. Projections with plasticity reduced
   extinction risk by 72\% under climate warming, especially in the core of
   their range. Further analyses revealed that juveniles might experience
   the greatest physiological stress under climate warming, but we
   identified specific physiological adaptations or plastic responses that
   could minimize the lethal physiological stress imposed on juveniles. We
   conclude that incorporating plasticity fundamentally alters ecological
   predictions under climate change by reducing extinction risk in the
   hotspot of salamander diversity.},

Abstract = {Determining the susceptibility of species to changing thermal niches is
   a major goal for biologists. In this paper we develop an
   eco-physiological model of extinction risk under climate change premised
   on behavioral thermoregulation. Our method downscales operative
   environmental temperatures, which restrict hours of activity of lizards,
   h(r), for present-day climate (1975) and future climate scenarios
   (2070). We apply our model using occurrence records of 20 Phrynocephalus
   lizards (or taxa in species complexes) drawn from literature and museum
   records. Our analysis is phylogenetically informed, because some clades
   may be more sensitive to rising temperatures. The limits for computed
   h(r) predict local extirpations among Phrynocephalus lizards at
   continental scales and delineate upper boundaries of thermal niches as
   defined by Extreme Value Distributions. Under the 8.5 Representative
   Concentration Pathway scenario, we predict extirpation of 64\% of local
   populations by 2070 across 20 Phrynocephalus species, and 12 are at high
   risk of total extinction due to thermal limits being exceeded. In tandem
   with global strategies of lower CO2 emissions, we propose regional
   strategies for establishing new national parks to protect
   extinction-prone taxa by preserving high-elevation climate refugia
   within existing sites of species occurrence. We propose that evolved
   acclimatization maternal plasticity may ameliorate risk, but is poorly
   studied. Previous studies revealed that adaptive maternal plasticity by
   thermoregulating gravid females alter progeny thermal preferences by +/-
   1 degrees C. We describe plasticity studies for extinction-prone species
   that could assess whether they might be buffered from climate warming a
   self-rescue. We discuss an epigenetic framework for studying such
   maternal-effect evolution.},

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},
Number = {6},

Abstract = {Infectious disease and climate change are considered major threats to
   biodiversity and act as drivers behind the global amphibian decline.
   This is, to a large extent, based on short-term studies that are
   designed to detect the immediate and strongest biodiversity responses to
   a threatening process. What few long-term studies are available,
   although typically focused on single species, report outcomes that often
   diverge significantly from the short-term species responses. Here, we
   report the results of an 18-year survey of an amphibian community
   exposed to both climate warming and the emergence of lethal
   chytridiomycosis. Our study shows that the impacts of infectious disease
   are ongoing but restricted to two out of nine species that form the
   community, despite the fact all species can become infected with the
   fungus. Climate warming appears to be affecting four out of the nine
   species, but the response of three of these is an increase in abundance.
   Our study supports a decreasing role of infectious disease on the
   community, and an increasing and currently positive effect of climate
   warming. We caution that if the warming trends continue, the net
   positive effect will turn negative as amphibian breeding habitat becomes
   unavailable as water bodies dry, a pattern that already may be underway.},

Title = {Social Climate Change: The Advancing Extirpation of Snowmobilers in
   Vermont},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PARK AND RECREATION ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Pages = {31-51},
Month = {SUM},
Abstract = {Climate change has potential to substantially affect the availability
   and quality of snow and thus has potential to affect snow-dependent
   winter recreation activities. Research has shown that participants in
   these recreation activities are adapting to climatically changed
   conditions and are likely to continue to adapt in the future. This study
   explores these issues as they apply to snowmobiling in Vermont,
   identifying a suite of climate change manifestations, investigating
   their salience to the snowmobiler recreation experience, and assessing
   how these manifestations may impact the snowmobile participation rate
   and quality of experience. Climate change manifestations are informed by
   climate change models, helping to define the future conditions and
   supply of snowmobiling opportunities. Social science research on how
   snowmobilers may adapt to these changing conditions helps define the
   future demand for snowmobiling. We conducted an online survey of
   snowmobilers in Vermont, asking respondents if and how they would change
   the amount of snowmobiling they do in response to climate change
   manifestations that may impact snowmobiling conditions. Study findings
   suggest that the amount of snowmobiling in Vermont is already declining
   and that these declines are likely to become more substantial. For
   example, 44.7\% of respondents have noticed declines in the length of
   the winter season during which there is enough snow to snowmobile, and
   30.7\% of respondents have decreased their amount of snowmobiling in
   response. Moreover, study data define the future relationship between
   climate-related changes in snowmobiling conditions and changes in amount
   of snowmobiling. For example, with 150 days of adequate snow cover, the
   amount of snowmobiling will increase 36.9\%, but with 25 days of
   adequate snow cover, the amount of snowmobiling will decrease 44\%. The
   length of season threshold for participation in snowmobiling is
   estimated at 79 days; more than 79 days will cause snowmobiling to
   increase from current levels, and fewer than 79 days will cause a
   decrease. Given the climate change sensitivity of snowmobiling found in
   this study, along with the predictions of climate models for Vermont,
   snowmobiling may ultimately be unsustainable. This will decrease the
   benefits of snowmobiling, including the enjoyment of locals and tourists
   who participate in the sport, the economic contributions, and the
   culture of the state. Substitution of other winter season recreation
   activities is a potential adaptation to declining opportunities for
   snowmobiling.},

Abstract = {The Late Ordovician mass extinction (LOME, ca. 445 Ma) was the first of
   the ``Big Five{''} Phanerozoic extinction events and comprised two
   extinction pulses. Proposed kill mechanisms include glacially induced
   global cooling and the expansion of water-column anoxia and/or euxinia
   (sulfidic conditions), but no general consensus has been reached with
   regard to the precise role of these mechanisms. A more definitive
   understanding is hampered by poorly constrained temporal links between
   the extinction pulses and climate change, and by uncertainty over the
   spatial distribution and intensity of euxinia. Here, we utilize Fe
   speciation and Mo concentrations, in addition to the chemical index of
   alteration weathering proxy, to reconstruct ocean redox conditions and
   climate change across a Late Ordovician to Early Silurian shelf-to-slope
   transect on the Yangtze Shelf Sea (a siliciclastic-dominated shelf basin
   in South China). These data show two cycles of expanded euxinia
   corresponding to the two pulses of the LOME, suggesting a strong causal
   relationship. Significantly, we show that intermittent or weak euxinia
   developed during the first extinction pulse, which likely accounts for
   the loss of benthic fauna and some planktonic organisms and nektonic
   groups. By contrast, the development of more intense euxinia throughout
   the water column during the second pulse likely drove survival fauna to
   extinction. Superimposed upon this, significant global cooling occurred
   across the first extinction phase, reflecting a secondary role in
   driving the extinction of certain low-latitude taxa.},

Abstract = {Neanderthals lived in Eurasia alongside anatomically modern humans
   (AMHs) until some 40,000 years ago. The extinction of Neanderthals is
   attributed to either climatic change, or to the effect of competition
   with AMHs. We used fossil occurrence records and paleoclimatic data to
   model the potential distributions of H. sapiens and H. neanderthalensis
   using Species Distribution Models, and calculated the degree of habitat
   quality and connectivity at successive time steps. We found that both
   species potential geographic ranges progressively retreated from their
   northeastern borders beginning with 44 ka. Although the degree of
   habitat loss is similar for the two species, the potential range for H.
   sapiens was constantly some 50\% larger on average. The degree of
   habitat fragmentation, and the size, number, and average distance
   between optimal habitat patches was initially very similar for the two
   species. However, all these landscape metrics showed a progressive
   deterioration for H. neanderthalensis only over time. At the end of
   their existence, the most suitable habitat patches for Neanderthals were
   small and isolated, and their inferred climatic niche width was
   statistically narrower than in H. sapiens. This does not mean that
   climate worsening drove Neanderthals extinct, yet it suggests extinction
   risk for the latter markedly increased over time, towards its actual
   extinction date.},

Abstract = {Evaluating the terrestrial climate record provides a critical test of

   by the onset of Deccan Traps volcanism, whereas the following short-term
   cooling then another warming episode were likely caused by Chicxulub
   impact and post-boundary volcanism. Our study suggests that the pCO(2)
   levels were probably the main control on the latest Cretaceous cooling
   and the climatic fluctuations across the K-Pg boundary interval in
   northern China. In the Songliao Basin, the pre-impact Deccan Traps
   volcanism links to losses of half of the lacustrine algae species
   (charophytes) and almost all of the lacustrine ostracodes; this suggests
   that the Deccan Traps volcanism had already destabilized the ecosystem

Abstract = {In the present study, we measured spatiotemporal properties of
   ecological niches of amphibians in China and tested the relative
   importance of various niche-diversity metrics for explaining the
   evolutionary distinctiveness-weighted extinction risk (EDGE) of
   amphibian species. We applied the hierarchical partitioning technique on
   the phylogenetically independent contrasts of the niche covariates and
   EDGE of amphibians, for the purpose of removing the influence of
   evolutionary inertia among species. As a comparison, phylogenetic
   least-square general regression (PLGS) was also conducted. The results
   showed that EDGE was high for those amphibian species of China
   identified as Critically Endangered or Endangered on the IUCN Red List.
   Niche fragmentation dimension (NFD) and niche position (NP) were the top
   two predictors across partial correlation analyses, hierarchical
   variation partitioning, PLGS and multiple regression analyses. Most
   temporal niche properties were not significantly associated with the
   EDGE index of amphibians. Variation partitioning analysis showed that
   the spatial component of niche measures explained the largest proportion
   of total variation in EDGE (similar to 31\%), whereas the temporal
   component of niche properties explained similar to 8\% of the variation.
   The significantly negative role of NFD and extinction risk of amphibians
   in China may be attributed to a reduced rescue effect, habitat geometry,
   and local extinction in species with large and continuous distributional
   ranges.},

Abstract = {The Permian-Triassicmass extinction (PTME) had an enormous impact on
   life in three ways: by substantially reducing diversity, by reshuffling
   the composition of ecosystems and by expelling life from the tropics
   following episodes of intense global warming. But was there really an
   `equatorial tetrapod gap', and how long did it last? Here, we consider
   both skeletal and footprint data, and find a more complex pattern: (i)
   tetrapods were distributed both at high and lowlatitudes during this
   time; (ii) therewas a clear geographic disjunction through the PTME,
   with tetrapod distribution shifting 10-158 poleward; and (iii) there was
   a rapid expansion phase across the whole of Pangea following the PTME.
   These changes are consistent with a model of generalized migration of
   tetrapods to higher latitudinal, cooler regions, to escape from the
   superhot equatorial climate in the earliest Triassic, but the effect was
   shorter in time scale, and not as pronounced as had been proposed. In
   the recovery phase following the PTME, this episode of forced range
   expansion also appears to have promoted the emergence and radiation of
   entirely new groups, such as the archosaurs, including the dinosaurs.},

Abstract = {Subterranean ecosystems present ideal opportunities to study mechanisms
   underlying responses to changes in climate because species within them
   are often adapted to a largely constant temperature. We have
   characterized the thermal conditions of caves in the western Alps, and
   related these hypogean climate data to the occurrence of Troglohyphantes
   spiders (Araneae, Linyphiidae). Our data indicated that present
   distributions reflect Pleistocene glaciation events and also pointed to
   specific responses as a consequence of changes in temperature. Constant
   temperatures recorded inside caves provide an approximation of the mean
   annual temperature outside, thus we extended the results to a regional
   scale. We used ecological niche modeling to predict habitat suitability
   both in the Pleistocene and under future global warming scenarios. These
   analyses pointed toward a future decline in habitat suitability for
   subterranean spiders and the potential extinction of the most restricted
   endemic species. When compared with other species that live in confined
   habitats such as islands and mountains, we expect cave species to be as
   much, if not more, vulnerable to climate change.},

Abstract = {It is firmly demonstrated in experiment that the self-absorption (SA)
   effect can lead to the extinction of the zero-phonon line and the
   first-order longitudinal optical phonon sideband of free excitonic
   luminescence of ZnO at room temperature. Moreover, effectiveness degree
   of SA effect is found to be dependent on both absorption coefficient and
   travelling distance of emitted photons, as well as even lattice
   temperature, which is uniquely reflected by the redshift amount in
   emission peak in ZnO. It is also unambiguously proved that the SA effect
   still strictly obeys the Beer-Lambert law of absorption. This work not
   only uncovers the long-term puzzle of significant redshift of emission
   peak of ZnO at higher temperatures, but also shows that the SA effect
   may have to be carefully taken into consideration in the study of
   spontaneous emission, laser and relevant optoelectronic processes in
   luminescent materials and optoelectronic devices. (C) 2017 Science China

Title = {Climate change change risks, extinction debt, and conservation
   implications for a threatened freshwater fish: Carmine shiner (Notropis
   percobromus)},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {598},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Climate change is affecting many freshwater species, particularly
   fishes. Predictions of future climate change suggest large and
   deleterious effects on species with narrow dispersal abilities due to
   limited hydrological connectivity. In turn, this creates the potential
   for population isolation in thermally unsuitable habitats, leading to
   physiological stress, species declines or possible extirpation. The
   current extent of many freshwater fish species' spatio-temporal
   distribution patterns and their sensitivity to thermal impacts from
   climate change critical information for conservation planning are often
   unknown. Carmine shiner (Notropis percobromus) is an ecologically
   important species listed as threatened or imperilled nationally (Canada)
   and regionally (South Dakota, United States) due to its restricted range
   and sensitivity to water quality and temperature. This research aimed to
   determine the current distribution and spatio-temporal variability in
   projected suitable habitat for Carmine shiner using niche-based modeling
   approaches (MaxEnt, BIOCLIM, and DOMAIN models). Statistically down
   scaled, bias-corrected Global Circulation Models (GCMs) data was used to
   model the distribution of Carmine shiner in central North America for
   the period of 2041-2060 (2050s). Maximum mean July temperature and
   temperature variability were the main factors in determining Carmine
   shiner distribution. Patterns of projected habitat change by the 2050s
   suggest the spatial extent of the current distribution of Carmine shiner
   would shift north, with >50\% of the current distribution changing with
   future projections based on two Representative Concentrations Pathways
   for CO2 emissions. Whereas the southern extent of the distribution would
   become unsuitable for Carmine shiner, suitable habitats are predicted to
   become available further north, if accessible. Importantly, the majority
   of habitat gains for Carmine shiner would be in areas currently
   inaccessible due to dispersal limitations, suggesting current
   populations may face an extinction debt within the next half century.
   These results provide evidence that Carmine shiner may be highly
   vulnerable to a warming climate and suggest that management actions -
   such as assisted migration - may be needed to mitigate impacts from
   climate change and ensure the long-term persistence of the species. (C)

Title = {Spatial extinction or persistence: landscape-temperature interactions
   perturb predator-prey dynamics},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {40},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1177-1186},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Recognising that species interact across a range of spatial scales, we
   explore how landscape structure interacts with temperature to influence
   persistence. Specifically, we recognise that few studies indicate
   thermal shifts as the proximal cause of species extinctions; rather,
   species interactions exacerbated by temperature result in extinctions.
   Using microcosm-based experiments, as models of larger landscape
   processes, we test hypotheses that would be problematic to address
   through field work. A text-book predator-prey system (the ciliates
   Didinium and Paramecium) was used to compare three landscapes: an
   unfragmented landscape subjected to uniform temperatures (10, 20, 30
   degrees C); a fragmented landscape (potentially hosting metapopulations)
   subjected to these three temperatures; and a fragmented landscape
   subjected to a spatial temperature gradient (-10 to 30 degrees C) -
   despite the prevalence of natural temperature ecoclines this is the
   first time such an analysis has been conducted. Initial thermal
   response-analysis (growth, mortality, and movement measured between 10
   and 30 degrees C) suggested that as temperature increased, the predator
   might drive the prey to extinction. Thermal preferences (measured at 5
   temperatures between 10 and 30 degrees C), indicated that both predator
   and prey preferred warmer temperatures, with the predator exhibiting the
   stronger preference, suggesting that cooler regions might act as a
   prey-refuge. The landscape level observations, however, did not entirely
   support the predictions. First, in the unfragmented landscape, increased
   temperature led to extinctions, but at the highest temperature (where
   the predator growth can be reduced) the prey survived. Second, at high
   temperatures the fragmented landscape failed to host metapopulations
   that would allow predator-prey persistence. Third, the thermal ecocline
   did not provide heterogeneity that improved stability; rather it forced
   both species to occupy a smaller realized space, leading toward
   extinctions. These findings reveal that temperature-impacted rates and
   temperature preferences combine to drive predator-prey dynamics and
   persistence across landscapes.},

Volume = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Climate change is a well-documented driver of both wildlife extinction
   and disease emergence, but the negative impacts of climate change on
   parasite diversity are undocumented. We compiled the most comprehensive
   spatially explicit data set available for parasites, projected range
   shifts in a changing climate, and estimated extinction rates for eight
   major parasite clades. On the basis of 53,133 occurrences capturing the
   geographic ranges of 457 parasite species, conservative model
   projections suggest that 5 to 10\% of these species are committed to
   extinction by 2070 from climate-driven habitat loss alone. We find no
   evidence that parasites with zoonotic potential have a significantly
   higher potential to gain range in a changing climate, but we do find
   that ectoparasites (especially ticks) fare disproportionately worse than
   endoparasites. Accounting for host-driven coextinctions, models predict
   that up to 30\% of parasitic worms are committed to extinction, driven
   by a combination of direct and indirect pressures. Despite high local
   extinction rates, parasite richness could still increase by an order of
   magnitude in some places, because species successfully tracking climate
   change invade temperate ecosystems and replace native species with
   unpredictable ecological consequences.},

Abstract = {Sun-tracking (ST) microwave radiometry is a technique where the Sun is

   The antenna noise temperature of a ground-based microwave radiometer is

   tracking it along its diurnal ecliptic. During clear sky the brightness
   temperature of the Sun disk emission at K and Ka band and in the
   unexplored millimeter-wave frequency region at V and W band can be
   estimated by adopting different techniques. Using a unique dataset
   collected during 2015 through a ST multifrequency radiometer, the Sun
   brightness temperature shows a decreasing behavior with frequency with
   values from about 9000 K at K band down to about 6600 K at W band. In
   the presence of precipitating clouds the ST technique can also provide
   an accurate estimate of the atmospheric extinction up to about 32 dB at

Title = {Study of the low-temperature reactivity of large n-alkanes through cool
   diffusion flame extinction},
Journal = {COMBUSTION AND FLAME},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {179},
Pages = {23-32},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The low-temperature oxidation of hydrocarbon fuels has received
   increasing attention as advanced engines seek to operate in less
   conventional combustion regimes. Large n-alkanes are a notable component
   of many real transportation fuels and possess strong reactivity in this
   important low-temperature range. These n-alkanes have been studied
   extensively in various canonical kinetic experiments but seldom in
   systems with strong coupling between low-temperature chemistry,
   transport, and heat release. To address this issue, the present study
   investigates self-sustaining n-alkane cool diffusion flames in a
   counterflow burner. The extinction limits of both hot diffusion flames
   and cool diffusion flames are measured at atmospheric pressure for a
   range of n-alkanes from n-heptane to n-tetradecane. It is observed that
   while these fuels behave similarly for hot flames, the larger n-alkanes
   are substantially more reactive in the low-temperature cool flame
   regime. Moreover, ozone addition strongly enhances the low-temperature
   chemistry to the point where the differences in fuel reactivity are
   nearly suppressed.
   The experimental measurements are compared with numerical simulations
   employing both detailed and reduced chemical kinetic models of various
   sizes. Although the different kinetic models adequately predict the
   extinction limits of the hot flames, a large scatter is present in the
   model results for cool flames, and a general overprediction of the
   measured cool flame extinction limit is observed for all of the fuels
   studied. This implies that the cool flame heat release is not well
   agreed upon by the current chemical kinetic models, despite their
   capability to reproduce many homogeneous reactor experiments at low
   temperatures. Furthermore, it is observed that the cool flame heat
   release is spread over a substantial number of reactions involving large
   molecules, a trait that makes it particularly difficult to create
   reduced kinetic models that can accurately describe cool flame behavior.
   The results of this study suggest that the cool flame platform can
   provide crucial validation of the coupling between chemistry, transport,
   and heat release in flames at low temperatures. (C) 2017 The Combustion

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Aims Sea-level rise is one of the most certain consequences of global
   warming and is predicted to exert significant adverse effects on
   wildlife in coastal habitats worldwide. Terrestrial fauna inhabiting
   low-lying islands are likely to suffer the greatest loss to habitat from
   sea-level rise and other oceanographic impacts stemming from
   anthropogenic climate change. Bramble Cay (Maizab Kaur), an similar to
   4ha, low elevation sand cay located in Torres Strait, Australia,
   supports the only known population of the endangered Bramble Cay melomys
   Melomys rubicola Thomas, 1924. As a result of a decline in this
   population noted during previous monitoring to 2004, habitat loss due to
   erosion of the cay and direct mortality from storm surges were
   implicated as major threats to this species. This study aimed to confirm
   the current conservation status of the species, to seek information
   about the key factor or factors responsible for the population decline
   and to recover any remaining individuals for a captive insurance
   population.
   Methods During three survey periods (December 2011, March 2014 and
   August-September 2014), a total of 1170 small mammal trap-nights, 60
   camera trap-nights, 5h of nocturnal searches and 5h of diurnal searches
   were undertaken on Bramble Cay.
   Key results All three survey periods failed to detect any Bramble Cay
   melomys. The island had experienced a recent, severe reduction in
   vegetation, which is the primary food resource for the Bramble Cay
   melomys. Herbaceous cover on the cay decreased from 2.16ha in 2004 to
   0.065ha in March 2014 before recovering somewhat to 0.19ha in
   August-September 2014.
   Conclusions These results demonstrate that this rodent species has now
   been extirpated on Bramble Cay. The vegetation decline was probably due
   to ocean inundation resulting from an increased frequency and intensity
   of weather events producing extreme high water levels and storm surges,
   in turn caused by anthropogenic climate change.
   Implications The loss of the Bramble Cay melomys from Bramble Cay
   probably represents the first documented mammalian extinction due to
   human-induced climate change. This event highlights the immediate need
   to mitigate predicted impacts of sea-level rise and ocean inundation on
   other vulnerable species occurring on low lying islands and in
   susceptible coastal zones through captive breeding and reintroduction or
   other targeted measures.},

Abstract = {Identifying climatic drivers of an animal population's vital rates and
   locating where they operate steers conservation efforts to optimize
   species recovery. The population growth of endangered whooping cranes
   (Grus americana) hinges on juvenile recruitment. Therefore, we identify
   climatic drivers (solar activity {[}sunspots] and weather) of whooping
   crane recruitment throughout the species' life cycle (breeding,
   migration, wintering). Our method uses a repeated cross-validated
   absolute shrinkage and selection operator approach to identify drivers
   of recruitment. We model effects of climate change on those drivers to
   predict whooping crane population growth given alternative scenarios of
   climate change and solar activity. Years with fewer sunspots indicated
   greater recruitment. Increased precipitation during autumn migration
   signified less recruitment. On the breeding grounds, fewer days below
   freezing during winter and more precipitation during breeding suggested
   less recruitment. We predicted whooping crane recruitment and population
   growth may fall below long-term averages during all solar cycles when
   atmospheric CO2 concentration increases, as expected, to 500ppm by 2050.
   Species recovery during a typical solar cycle with 500ppm may require
   eight times longer than conditions without climate change and the chance
   of population decline increases to 31\%. Although this whooping crane
   population is growing and may appear secure, long-term threats imposed
   by climate change and increased solar activity may jeopardize its
   persistence. Weather on the breeding grounds likely affects recruitment
   through hydrological processes and predation risk, whereas precipitation
   during autumn migration may influence juvenile mortality. Mitigating
   threats or abating climate change should occur within approximate to
   30years or this wild population of whooping cranes may begin declining.},

Abstract = {Five species of mouse or forest shrews (Myosorex) are endemic to South
   Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland, four of which (Myosorex varius, Myosorex
   cafer, Myosorex longicaudatus and Myosorex cf. tenuis) are associated
   with montane or temperate grassland, fynbos and/or forest habitats while
   a fifth (Myosorex sclateri) is associated with lowland subtropical
   forests. Due to their small size, specialised habitat, low dispersal
   capacity, high metabolism and sensitivity to temperature extremes, we
   predicted that, particularly for montane species, future climate change
   should have a negative impact on area of occupancy (AOO) and ultimately
   extinction risks. Species distribution models (SDMs) indicated general
   declines in AOO of three species by 2050 under the A1b and A2 climate
   change scenarios (M. cafer, M. varius, M. longicaudatus) while two
   species (M. sclateri and M. cf. tenuis) remained unchanged (assuming no
   dispersal) or increased their AOO (assuming dispersal). While temperate
   species such as M. varius appear to be limited by temperature maxima
   (preferring cooler temperatures), the subtropical species M. sclateri
   appears to be limited by temperature minima (preferring warmer
   temperatures). Evidence for declines in AOO informed the uplisting (to a
   higher category of threat) of the Red List status of four Myosorex
   species to either vulnerable or endangered as part of a separate
   regional International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List
   assessment.},

Title = {Extinction risk of North American seed plants elevated by climate and
   land-use change},

Volume = {54},

Abstract = {Climate and land-use change are expected to substantially alter future
   plant species distributions leading to higher extinction rates. However,
   little is known about how plant species ranges, richness and
   phylogenetic diversity of continents will be affected by these dynamics.
   We address this gap here by examining the patterns of species'
   distributions and phylogenetic relationships for 7465 seed plant taxa in
   North America. An ensemble of species distribution models was used to
   estimate the potential suitable habitat of species under different sets
   of climate, land-use and dispersal constraint scenarios. We then
   evaluated the vulnerability and extinction risk of individual species to
   changes in climate and land use, and examined whether rare, endangered
   and evolutionarily distinct species were disproportionally threatened by
   climate and land-use change. We show that similar to 2000 species may
   lose >80\% of their suitable habitats under the A1b emission scenario
   for the 2080s, while similar to 100 species may experience >80\% range
   expansions (a 20:1 ratio of loss to gain). When considering >50\% range
   retraction and expansion, the ratio of loss to gain was 13:1. A greater
   loss of species diversity is expected at low latitudes, while larger
   gains are expected at high latitudes. Evolutionarily distinct species
   are predicted to have significantly higher extinction risks than extant
   species. This suggests a disproportionate future loss of phylogenetic
   diversity for the North American flora.Synthesis and applications. Our
   study provides continental-scale evidence of plant species extinction
   risk caused by future climate and land-use change, and highlights the
   importance of integrating phylogenetic measures into conservation risk
   assessments. This work provides insight into the status, trends and
   threats for a large share of North America's plant species by
   identifying risks and prioritizing conservation in a rapidly changing
   world.},

Title = {Flame extinction and low-temperature combustion of isolated fuel
   droplets of n-alkanes},
Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Pages = {2531-2539},
Abstract = {A recent set of experiments carried out onboard the International Space
   Station (ISS) have shown that large n-alkane droplets, after the
   radiative extinction of the visible flame, can burn quasi-steadily in a
   low-temperature regime, up to a diffusive extinction accompanied by the
   formation of a vapor cloud. The experiments have also demonstrated that
   small droplets are unable to exhibit radiative extinction, but instead
   burn to completion or disruptively extinguish.
   In this work, we applied a mathematical model able to reproduce the
   experimental data in terms of vaporization rates, standoff ratios,
   extinction diameters. A detailed kinetic mechanism (with similar to 450
   species and similar to 17,000 reactions) was taken into account, in
   order to correctly reproduce the low-temperature combustion regime. The
   role of several parameters (initial diameter of the droplet, composition
   of the gaseous environment, and pressure) on the extinction of the
   hot-temperature flames was numerically investigated. Predictions are
   found in good agreement with experimental measurements, showing that
   only droplets with an initial diameter larger than a critical diameter
   undergo radiative extinction. A linear relationship between the squared
   critical diameter and the molar fraction of oxygen in the atmosphere was
   found and demonstrated on the basis of scaling arguments. (C) 2016 by

Title = {Climate change, human overkill, and the extinction of megafauna: a
   macroecological approach based on pattern-oriented modelling},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1-2},

Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Background: The debate on Late Quaternary extinctions (LQE) has long
   been centred on the contrast between climatic and human-related
   explanations, with no consensus being reached. Here we propose a
   macroecological approach to study LQE that combines niche and
   demographic models to determine the ecological mechanisms behind the
   megafauna extinction.
   Question: Is the overkill hypothesis plausible and realistic when
   assessing the ecological mechanisms behind LQE? What is the range of
   population parameters for both human and now-extinct animals that is
   consistent with the actual extinction pattern?
   Features of model: Ecological niche models (ENMs) are used to assess
   climate impact on population viability, whereas density-dependent
   population models with reciprocal feedback between humans and their prey
   are used to simulate human hunting pressure. The feasibility of
   predicted extinction scenarios and explored parameter space is ordered
   based on a pattern-oriented modelling (POM) approach. We illustrate the
   usefulness of our framework using the extinct South American ground
   sloth Megatherium as an example.
   Methods: We built ENMs by using fossil occurrences records and
   palaeoclimatic simulations from the last glacial cycle and projected
   their predictions to the Holocene. Population modelling was based on
   4000 random samples of ENM ensembles, from which prey density was
   estimated using a Gaussian central-peripheral abundance model. For each
   ensemble, a plausible range of demographic parameters (e.g. growth rate,
   carrying capacity, mortality of human population, meat consumption) was
   set across 100 random repetitions, giving 400,000 models simulating
   Megatherium's extinction dynamics.
   Results: The macroecological approach highlighted many plausible
   mechanistic extinction scenarios capable of reproducing a wide range of
   hypotheses about the LQE. Most models ;(51\%) simulating a vigorous
   human population with unrealistic growth rates (r(h) > 1.3\% per year)
   and intense over-exploitation of prey (individual
   meat-consumption-rate-CI > 100 g per day from one prey only) produced
   scenarios of rapid extinction as predicted by the overkill hypothesis.
   However, such overkill scenarios unrealistically predicted earlier
   extinction times than that observed for Megatherium. Moreover, the high
   human population growth required to simulate overkill scenarios was
   attained only recently after the industrial revolution, specifically in
   the mid-1900s, and it is therefore not applicable for Pleistocene
   hunter-gatherers. Conversely, although less frequent across simulations,
   models that correctly predicted the observed extinction time (16\%)
   revealed plausible and empirically acceptable demographic parameters,
   encompassing low growth rates (r(h) < 0.70\%) and mortality for the
   human population (mo < 0.60\%), combined with moderate values of
   individual meat consumption (CI > 70 g) and geographical range collapse
   in Megatherium, which is produced by climate change.
   Conclusions: These findings, based on POM reasoning, highlight that
   unique mechanisms such as the overkill explanation for LQE, although
   feasible from model simulations, only occur with implausible parameter
   combinations and predict unrealistic extinction dynamics.},

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},

Month = {DEC 23},
Abstract = {Impacts of climate change on individual species are increasingly well
   documented, but we lack understanding of how these effects propagate
   through ecological communities. Here we combine species distribution
   models with ecological network analyses to test potential impacts of
   climate change on >700 plant and animal species in pollination and
   seed-dispersal networks from central Europe. We discover that animal
   species that interact with a low diversity of plant species have narrow
   climatic niches and are most vulnerable to climate change. In contrast,
   biotic specialization of plants is not related to climatic niche breadth
   and vulnerability. A simulation model incorporating different scenarios
   of species coextinction and capacities for partner switches shows that
   projected plant extinctions under climate change are more likely to
   trigger animal coextinctions than vice versa. This result demonstrates
   that impacts of climate change on biodiversity can be amplified via
   extinction cascades from plants to animals in ecological networks.},

Title = {Extinction debt from climate change for frogs in the wet tropics},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The effect of twenty-first-century climate change on biodiversity is
   commonly forecast based on modelled shifts in species ranges, linked to
   habitat suitability. These projections have been coupled with
   species-area relationships (SAR) to infer extinction rates indirectly as
   a result of the loss of climatically suitable areas and associated
   habitat. This approach does not model population dynamics explicitly,
   and so accepts that extinctions might occur after substantial (but
   unknown) delays-an extinction debt. Here we explicitly couple
   bioclimatic envelopemodels of climate and habitat suitability with
   generic life-history models for 24 species of frogs found in the
   Australian Wet Tropics (AWT). We show that (i) as many as four species
   of frogs face imminent extinction by 2080, due primarily to climate
   change; (ii) three frogs face delayed extinctions; and (iii) this
   extinction debt will take at least a century to be realized in full.
   Furthermore, we find congruence between forecast rates of extinction
   using SARs, and demographic models with an extinction lag of 120 years.
   We conclude that SAR approaches can provide useful advice to
   conservation on climate change impacts, provided there is a good
   understanding of the time lags over which delayed extinctions are likely
   to occur.},

Abstract = {For problems like global climate change that may involve global
   extinction, we must not just focus, as most economic analysts do, on the
   trading-off of current consumption (current mitigation investment
   reduces consumption) against future consumption (less need for future
   investment), but also consider the effects of mitigation investment in
   reducing the extinction probabilities. Future utility/welfare values
   should only be discounted at the uncertainty of their realization,
   making these values even in the far future important as this discount
   rate should be very low (0.01 per cent per annum or less). Immediate and
   strong actions of environmental protection including greenhouse gas
   reduction may thus be justified despite high consumption discount rates
   (about 5 per cent). Unexpectedly, an increase in the extinction
   probabilities may increase or decrease our willingness to reduce them;
   precise conditions are given. The related intuition that, the higher the
   probability of destruction of your house by fire, the less willing you
   will be in investing on things like interior decoration that does not
   change the probability of destruction, but the higher your willingness
   to pave a fire clearance that does reduce the probability of
   destruction, is examined.},

Volume = {26},
Number = {6},

Abstract = {Chemical contamination is often suggested as an important contributing
   factor to amphibian population declines, but direct links are rarely
   reported. Population modeling provides a quantitative method to
   integrate toxicity data with demographic data to understand the
   long-term effects of contaminants on population persistence. In this
   study we use laboratory-derived embryo and larval toxicity data for two
   anuran species to investigate the potential for toxicity to contribute
   to population declines. We use the southern toad (Anaxyrus terrestris)
   and the southern leopard frog (Lithobates sphenocephalus) as model
   species to investigate copper (Cu) toxicity. We use matrix models to
   project populations through time and quantify extinction risk (the
   probability of quasi-extinction in 35 yr). Life-history parameters for
   toads and frogs were obtained from previously published literature or
   unpublished data from a long-term (>35 yr) data set. In addition to Cu
   toxicity, we investigate the role of climate change on amphibian
   populations by including the probability of early pond drying that
   results in catastrophic reproductive failure (CRF, i.e., complete
   mortality of all larval individuals). Our models indicate that CRF is an
   important parameter for both species as both were unable to persist when
   CRF probability was >50\% for toads or 40\% for frogs. Copper toxicity
   alone did not result in significant effects on extinction risk unless
   toxicity was very high (>50\% reduction in survival parameters). For
   toads, Cu toxicity and high probability of CRF both resulted in high
   extinction risk but no synergistic (or greater than additive) effects
   between the two stressors occurred. For leopard frogs, in the absence of
   CRF survival was high even under Cu toxicity, but with CRF Cu toxicity
   increased extinction risk. Our analyses highlight the importance of
   considering multiple stressors as well as species differences in
   response to those stressors. Our models were consistently most sensitive
   to juvenile and adult survival, further suggesting the importance of
   terrestrial stages to population persistence. Future models will
   incorporate multiple wetlands with different combinations of stressors
   to understand if our results for a single wetland result in a population
   sink within the landscape.},

Abstract = {Mass extinctions disrupt ecological communities. Although climate
   changes produce stress in ecological communities, few paleobio-logical
   studies have systematically addressed the impact of global climate
   changes on the fine details of community structure with a view to
   understanding how changes in community structure presage, or even cause,
   biodiversity decline during mass extinctions. Based on a novel Bayesian
   approach to biotope assessment, we present a study of changes in species
   abundance distribution patterns of macroplanktonic graptolite faunas
   (similar to 447-444 Ma) leading into the Late Ordovician mass
   extinction. Communities at two contrasting sites exhibit significant
   decreases in complexity and evenness as a consequence of the
   preferential decline in abundance of dysaerobic zone specialist species.
   The observed changes in community complexity and evenness commenced well
   before the dramatic population depletions that mark the tipping point of
   the extinction event. Initially, community changes tracked changes in
   the oceanic water masses, but these relations broke down during the
   onset of mass extinction. Environmental isotope and biomarker data
   suggest that sea surface temperature and nutrient cycling in the
   paleotropical oceans changed sharply during the latest Katian time, with
   consequent changes in the extent of the oxygen minimum zone and
   phytoplankton community composition. Although many impacted species
   persisted in ephemeral populations, increased extinction risk
   selectively depleted the diversity of paleotropical graptolite species
   during the latest Katian and early Hirnantian. The effects of long-term
   climate change on habitats can thus degrade populations in ways that
   cascade through communities, with effects that culminate in mass
   extinction.},

Title = {Global climate change driven by soot at the K-Pg boundary as the cause
   of the mass extinction},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUL 14},
Abstract = {The mass extinction of life 66 million years ago at the
   Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary, marked by the extinctions of dinosaurs
   and shallow marine organisms, is important because it led to the
   macroevolution of mammals and appearance of humans. The current
   hypothesis for the extinction is that an asteroid impact in present-day
   Mexico formed condensed aerosols in the stratosphere, which caused the
   cessation of photosynthesis and global near-freezing conditions. Here,
   we show that the stratospheric aerosols did not induce darkness that
   resulted in milder cooling than previously thought. We propose a new
   hypothesis that latitude-dependent climate changes caused by massive
   stratospheric soot explain the known mortality and survival on land and
   in oceans at the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary. The stratospheric soot
   was ejected from the oil-rich area by the asteroid impact and was spread
   globally. The soot aerosols caused sufficiently colder climates at
   mid-high latitudes and drought with milder cooling at low latitudes on
   land, in addition to causing limited cessation of photosynthesis in
   global oceans within a few months to two years after the impact,
   followed by surface-ater cooling in global oceans in a few years. The
   rapid climate change induced terrestrial extinctions followed by marine
   extinctions over several years.},

Title = {Neotethys seawater chemistry and temperature at the dawn of the end
   Permian mass extinction},
Journal = {GONDWANA RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {35},
Pages = {272-285},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The end of the Permian was a time of great death and massive upheaval in
   the biosphere, atmosphere and hydrosphere. Over the last decades, many
   causes have been suggested to be responsible for that catastrophe such
   as global warming, anoxia and acidification. The Gyanyima limestone
   block was an open ocean seamount in the southern Neotethys at
   subtropical latitude, and it affords us insight into open-ocean
   oceanographic changes during the end of the Permian. After careful
   screening using multiple tests, we reconstructed carbonate/seawater
   curves from the geochemical data stored in pristine brachiopod shell
   archives from the shallow water limestone of the Changhsingian Gyanyima
   Formation of Tibet. The reconstructed strontium isotope curve and data
   for the late Changhsingian are relatively invariant about 0.707013, but
   in the upper part of the succession the values become more radiogenic
   climaxing at about 0.707244. The Sr-87/Si-86 curve and trend are similar
   to those observed for the Upper Permian succession in northern Italy,
   but dissimilar (less radiogenic) to whole rock results from Austria,
   Iran, China and Spitsbergen. The Ce/Ce{*} anomaly results ranging from
   0310 to 0577 for the brachiopods and from 0.237 to 0.655 for the coeval
   whole rock before the event, and of 0276 for whole rock during the
   extinction event, suggest normal redox conditions. These Ce{*} values
   are typical of normal open-ocean oxic water quality conditions observed
   in modern and other ancient counterparts. The biota and Ce{*}
   information clearly discounts global anoxia as a primary cause for the
   end-Permian biotic crisis. Carbon isotopes from brachiopod shells and
   whole rock are relatively invariant for most of the latest Permian
   interval, which is in stark contrast to the distinct negative carbon
   isotope excursion observed near and about the event. Estimates of
   seawater temperature at shallow depth fluctuated from 222 to 29.0
   degrees C up to unit 8-2, and then gradually rise from 29.7 degrees C in
   unit 8-13 to values exceeding 35 degrees C at a stratigraphic level
   about 120 ky before the Permian-Triassic boundary, and just before the
   onset of the extinction interval. This dramatic increase in seawater
   temperature has been observed in global successions from tropical to mid
   latitude and from restricted to open ocean localities (e.g., northern
   Italy, Iran). The brachiopod archive and its geochemical proxies from
   Tibet support the paradigm that global warming must have been an
   important factor of the biotic crisis for the terrestrial and marine
   faunas and floras of the late Paleozoic world. (C) 2015 International

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The cause of the end-Cretaceous (KPg) mass extinction is still debated
   due to difficulty separating the influences of two closely timed
   potential causal events: eruption of the Deccan Traps volcanic province
   and impact of the Chicxulub meteorite. Here we combine published
   extinction patterns with a new clumped isotope temperature record from a
   hiatus-free, expanded KPg boundary section from Seymour Island,
   Antarctica. We document a 7.8 +/- 3.3 degrees C warming synchronous with
   the onset of Deccan Traps volcanism and a second, smaller warming at the
   time of meteorite impact. Local warming may have been amplified due to
   simultaneous disappearance of continental or sea ice. Intra-shell
   variability indicates a possible reduction in seasonality after Deccan
   eruptions began, continuing through the meteorite event. Species
   extinction at Seymour Island occurred in two pulses that coincide with
   the two observed warming events, directly linking the end-Cretaceous
   extinction at this site to both volcanic and meteorite events via
   climate change.},

Abstract = {The behavior of different viscous models on the non-premixed swirling

Abstract = {De-extinction is becoming potentially feasible for restoring extinct
   species in the wild, but research is required to determine the
   likelihood of success in light of contemporary and future environmental
   change. We assessed 1900-2100 change in suitable climate and land cover
   in the historic range of Carolina parakeet (Conuropsis carolinensis),
   ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis) and passenger pigeon
   (Ectopistes migratorius), in North America. Parakeet and woodpecker
   historic range currently remains climatically-favourable, but
   intensified land use has broadly reduced habitat in contemporary
   landscapes. For passenger pigeon, more substantive loss in climate and
   land cover suitability exists in both the historic full range and
   primary breeding range. Long-term climate and land cover projections
   suggest that improved habitat suitability and increased potential future
   distribution outside historic ranges are likely for each de-extinction
   candidate. While such changes could improve probability of success for
   de-extinction programs, extensive mismatch between historic and future
   habitat suitability highlights the potential risks of reviving species
   that may colonize novel geographic space. To date, potential long-term
   negative effects of de-extinction programs to ecosystems outside
   historic ranges have not been elucidated, making this a priority concern
   for any serious proposal. To address whether benefits of reinstating
   extinct species to historic ecosystems outweigh risks to extant species
   outside their historic range will require extensive ecological, social
   and economic analyses that extend beyond that conducted to-date for this

Abstract = {Global climate change is impacting the distribution and abundance of
   species acting as a major cause of species extinction. It is rapid in
   freshwater swamp forest ecosystems, since they support disproportionate
   levels of biodiversity compared to their spatial coverage. The natural
   swamp forests of Bangladesh have been especially susceptible to climate
   change as they are limited in range to a few scattered patches in the
   north-eastern region. We sought to understand how climate change may
   impact the swamp forests of Bangladesh by modelling distributional
   changes in Pongamia pinnata and Barringtonia acutangula species, which
   dominate or co-dominate most swamp forest ecosystems across Bangladesh.
   We used the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modelling tool, combined
   presence-only data of species and bioclimatic variables for two climate
   scenarios (RCP6.0 and RCP8.5). We compared current, 2050 and 2070
   distributions. Results suggest that plant extractable water holding
   capacity of soil, annual precipitation, precipitation of warmest quarter
   and mean annual actual evapotranspiration are the key bioclimatic
   variables for the distribution of both trees. The MaxEnt models indicate
   that Pongamia pinnata and Barringtonia acutangula trees of Bangladesh
   face increasing climate stress and may become extinction under both
   mid-range and extreme climate scenarios.},

Title = {Living on burrowed time: Aestivating fishes in south-western Australia
   face extinction due to climate change},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {195},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Climate change poses a severe global threat to freshwater ecosystems.
   Aestivating freshwater fauna (i.e., those that undergo periods of
   dominancy during dry periods) are likely to be highly susceptible to
   climate change due to their unique life-cycles, although empirical data
   that demonstrates this are lacking. This study utilised two aestivating
   fishes as model species, the salamanderfish, Lepidogalaxias
   salamandroides, and the black-stripe minnow, Galaxiella nigrostriata;
   both of which are endemic to Australia's Southwestern Province, an area
   undergoing a severe drying trend that global climate models project will
   continue. We found that the distributions of both species have undergone
   large reductions in extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy
   (AOO), coinciding with an extensive period of severe drying of the
   region. L. salamandroides was more likely to be found in deeper pools,
   while G. nigrostriata was found more often in pools with greater
   connectivity, and the probability of occurrence of both species was
   significantly associated with lower water temperature and pH, and higher
   oxidation-reduction potential. The majority of those factors are
   strongly influenced by the local climate, as stable isotope analyses
   found the hydrology of the pools in which they occurred was influenced
   by winter rainfall, either through direct input and/or expression from a
   superficial aquifer. This suggests that increasing water temperature and
   declining rainfall, features of the climatic shift in south-western
   Australia over the last 40 years, have been the major drivers of the
   observed declines in range. Given that climate models project both
   continued rainfall reductions within the species' distributional ranges
   and water table decreases by up to 4 m by 2030, further population
   losses are expected. Moreover, a review of the distribution of
   aestivating fish species throughout the world revealed that 75\% are
   found in regions projected to dry due to climate change. This has
   considerable management implications, and active intervention, such as
   the protection of their existing environments and the creation of new
   suitable habitats, is required to prevent species declines. Fortunately,
   at least for the two aestivating species found in Western Australia,
   artificial ponds are utilised and therefore the construction of new
   waterbodies could help halt their decline, although further research is
   required to develop the optimal design for species persistence. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Binary nanofluids form a new class of nanofluids made through the
   simultaneous dispersion of two dissimilar nanoparticles in a base fluid.
   Two different nanoparticles may behave differently from their
   constituent components. Given the wide applications of binary nanofluids
   in a variety of fields, it is important to gain an understanding of the
   best stability conditions for binary nanofluids. In this work, the
   effects of such nanofluid properties as pH, surfactant (SHMP)
   concentration, and ultrasonic time are experimentally investigated on
   the stability of binary nanofluids. For this purpose, binary nanofluids
   are prepared using the two-step method. Two dissimilar nanoparticles,
   i.e. CuO and gamma-Al2O3 nanoparticles are dispersed in ethylene glycol
   and in the ethylene glycol-water mixture to form the desired nanofluids.
   Results show that at optimal stability conditions, viscosity and
   absorbency of the nanofluids are minimum and maximum, respectively.
   Also, the stability optimal parameters of binary nanofluids are found to
   be different from their corresponding values for each individual
   nanofluid. The extinction coefficient of the binary nanofluid is found
   to be approximately equal to the sum of those of the constituent
   components. Finally, the extinction coefficient of the nanoparticles
   dispersed in the mixture of ethylene glycol-water is determined to be
   greater than that of ethylene glycol. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Late Quaternary megafauna extinctions impoverished mammalian diversity
   worldwide. The causes of these extinctions in Australia are most
   controversial but essential to resolve, because this continent-wide
   event presaged similar losses that occurred thousands of years later on
   other continents. Here we apply a rigorous metadata analysis and new
   ensemble-hindcasting approach to 659 Australian megafauna fossil ages.
   When coupled with analysis of several high-resolution climate records,
   we show that megafaunal extinctions were broadly synchronous among
   genera and independent of climate aridity and variability in Australia
   over the last 120,000 years. Our results reject climate change as the
   primary driver of megafauna extinctions in the world's most
   controversial context, and instead estimate that the megafauna
   disappeared Australia-wide similar to 13,500 years after human arrival,
   with shorter periods of coexistence in some regions. This is the first
   comprehensive approach to incorporate uncertainty in fossil ages,
   extinction timing and climatology, to quantify mechanisms of

   end-Permian extinction coincides with the onset of a negative carbon
   isotope excursion whilst the deep-water extinctions occur around the
   lowpoint of the carbon isotope curve. Rapidly increasing surface water
   temperatures, and the effects of deep-water anoxia were all important

Abstract = {This paper is devoted to the study of the persistence versus extinction
   of species in the reaction diffusion equation:
   u(t) - Delta u = f (t, x(1) - ct, y, u) t > 0, x is an element of Omega,
   where Omega is of cylindrical type or partially periodic domain, f is of
   Fisher-KPP type and the scalar c > 0 is a given forced speed. This type
   of equation originally comes from a model in population dynamics (see
   {[}3,17,18]) to study the impact of climate change on the persistence
   versus extinction of species. From these works, we know that the
   dynamics is governed by the traveling fronts u(t, x(1), y) = U(x(1) -
   ct, y), thus characterizing the set of traveling fronts plays a major
   role. In this paper, we first consider a more general model than the
   model of {[}3] in higher dimensional space, where the environment is
   only assumed to be globally unfavorable with favorable pockets extending
   to infinity. We consider in two frameworks: the reaction term is
   time-independent or time-periodic dependent. For the latter, we study
   the concentration of the species when the environment outside becomes
   extremely unfavorable and further prove a symmetry breaking property of
   the fronts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   Risk due to Climate Change},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {13},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Evidence has accumulated in recent decades on the drastic impact of
   climate change on biodiversity. Warming temperatures have induced
   changes in species physiology, phenology, and have decreased body size.
   Such modifications can impact population dynamics and could lead to
   changes in life cycle and demography. More specifically, conceptual
   frameworks predict that global warming will severely threaten tropical
   ectotherms while temperate ectotherms should resist or even benefit from
   higher temperatures. However, experimental studies measuring the impacts
   of future warming trends on temperate ectotherms' life cycle and
   population persistence are lacking. Here we investigate the impacts of
   future climates on a model vertebrate ectotherm species using a
   large-scale warming experiment. We manipulated climatic conditions in 18
   seminatural populations over two years to obtain a present climate
   treatment and a warm climate treatment matching IPCC predictions for
   future climate. Warmer temperatures caused a faster body growth, an
   earlier reproductive onset, and an increased voltinism, leading to a
   highly accelerated life cycle but also to a decrease in adult survival.
   A matrix population model predicts that warm climate populations in our
   experiment should go extinct in around 20 y. Comparing our experimental
   climatic conditions to conditions encountered by populations across
   Europe, we suggest that warming climates should threaten a significant
   number of populations at the southern range of the distribution. Our
   findings stress the importance of experimental approaches on the entire
   life cycle to more accurately predict population and species persistence
   in future climates.},

   Lessons from plant-distribution models and current extinction trends in
   southern Germany},
Journal = {JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {27},
Pages = {18-25},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A higher risk of future range losses as a result of climate change is
   expected to be one of the main drivers of extinction trends in vascular
   plants occurring in habitat types of high conservation value.
   Nevertheless, the impact of the climate changes of the last 60 years on
   the current distribution and extinction patterns of plants is still
   largely unclear. We applied species distribution models to study the
   impact of environmental variables (climate, soil conditions, land cover,
   topography), on the current distribution of 18 vascular plant species
   characteristic of three threatened habitat types in southern Germany:
   (i) xero-thermophilous vegetation, (ii) mesophilous mountain grasslands
   (mountain hay meadows and matgrass communities), and (iii) wetland
   habitats (bogs, fens, and wet meadows).
   Climate and soil variables were the most important variables affecting
   plant distributions at a spatial level of 10 x 10 km. Extinction trends
   in our study area revealed that plant species which occur in wetland
   habitats faced higher extinction risks than those in xero-thermophilous
   vegetation, with the risk for species in mesophilous mountain grasslands
   being intermediary. For three plant species characteristic either of
   mesophilous mountain grasslands or wetland habitats we showed
   exemplarily that extinctions from 1950 to the present day have occurred
   at the edge of the species' current climatic niche, indicating that
   climate change has likely been the main driver of extinction. This is
   largely consistent with current extinction trends reported in other
   studies. Our study indicates that the analysis of past extinctions is an
   appropriate means to assess the impact of climate change on species and
   that vulnerability to climate change is both species- and
   habitat-specific. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Species depending on specific biotic interactions are particularly
   threatened by environmental changes. Therefore, host dependency in
   species living in parasitic relationships is acknowledged as a crucial
   factor increasing climatic susceptibility and species decline. In
   Maculinea butterflies and Myrmica ants, a complex form of social
   parasitism brings the butterflies into dependency of some few associated
   ant species for reproductive success. We evaluated to what extent these
   relations can be attributed to similarity in their climatic niches and
   whether alterations in niche overlap might foster the climatic
   susceptibility in Maculinea butterflies under future climate change. We
   show that the niches of ants and butterflies differ significantly more
   than expected at random corresponding to the observed flexibility in
   host exploitation. Moreover, a generally low degree of niche overlap and
   similar niche overlap scores between main and secondary host
   associations argue for a low host specificity of Maculinea butterflies.
   Pronounced range shifts and habitat retractions in all species will
   result in severe spatial limitations of Maculinea species by the
   presence of their hosts. No tightening in any of the host-parasite
   associations was detected under the pressure of range restrictions.
   Niche overlap scores remain comparably low in future scenarios and call
   for the possibility of extensive host shifts between all related
   species. Therefore, the absence of niche constraints might enable the
   parasites to extensively shift among hosts to allow the co-occurrence of
   several Maculinea species, in principle using the same host, and to
   maintain viable populations under the pressure of limited distributions
   and changing environments.},

Title = {Future habitat loss and extinctions driven by land-use change in
   biodiversity hotspots under four scenarios of climate-change mitigation},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1122-1131},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Numerous species have been pushed into extinction as an increasing
   portion of Earth's land surface has been appropriated for human
   enterprise. In the future, global biodiversity will be affected by both
   climate change and land-use change, the latter of which is currently the
   primary driver of species extinctions. How societies address climate
   change will critically affect biodiversity because climate-change
   mitigation policies will reduce direct climate-change impacts; however,
   these policies will influence land-use decisions, which could have
   negative impacts on habitat for a substantial number of species. We
   assessed the potential impact future climate policy could have on the
   loss of habitable area in biodiversity hotspots due to associated
   land-use changes. We estimated past extinctions from historical land-use
   changes (1500-2005) based on the global gridded land-use data used for
   the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report
   and habitat extent and species data for each hotspot. We then estimated
   potential extinctions due to future land-use changes under alternative
   climate-change scenarios (2005-2100). Future land-use changes are
   projected to reduce natural vegetative cover by 26-58\% in the hotspots.
   As a consequence, the number of additional species extinctions, relative
   to those already incurred between 1500 and 2005, due to land-use change
   by 2100 across all hotspots ranged from about 220 to 21000 (0.2\% to
   16\%), depending on the climate-change mitigation scenario and
   biological factors such as the slope of the species-area relationship
   and the contribution of wood harvest to extinctions. These estimates of
   potential future extinctions were driven by land-use change only and
   likely would have been higher if the direct effects of climate change
   had been considered. Future extinctions could potentially be reduced by
   incorporating habitat preservation into scenario development to reduce
   projected future land-use changes in hotspots or by lessening the impact
   of future land-use activities on biodiversity within hotspots.
   La Futura Perdida de Habitat y Extinciones Causados por el Cambio en el
   Uso de Suelo en los Puntos Clave de Biodiversidad bajo Cuatro Escenarios
   de Mitigacion de Cambio Climatico Se ha llevado a numerosas especies a
   la extincion conforme una porcion creciente de la superficie terrestre
   ha sido aduenada por actividades humanas. En el futuro, la biodiversidad
   global se vera afectada tanto por el cambio climatico como por el cambio
   en el uso de suelo, de los cuales el ultimo es actualmente el principal
   conductor de la extincion de especies. La manera en que las sociedades
   aborden el cambio climatico afectara criticamente a la biodiversidad ya
   que las politicas de mitigacion de cambio climatico reduciran
   directamente los impactos del cambio climatico; sin embargo, estas
   politicas influenciaran las decisiones de uso de suelo, lo que podria
   tener impactos negativos sobre el habitat de numerosas especies.
   Evaluamos el impacto potencial que podrian tener las futuras politicas
   de clima sobre la perdida del area habitable en los puntos clave de
   biodiversidad debido al cambio asociado en el uso de suelo. Estimamos
   las extinciones pasadas a partir de cambios historicos en el uso de
   suelo (1500 - 2005) con base en la extension del habitat, los datos de
   especies para cada punto clave, y la cuadricula global de datos sobre
   uso de suelo, la cual fue utilizada para el Reporte de la Quinta
   Evaluacion del Panel Intergubernamental sobre Cambio Climatico. Despues
   estimamos las extinciones potenciales causadas por futuros cambios en el
   uso de suelo bajo escenarios alternativos de cambio climatico (2005 -
   2100). El numero de extinciones de especies adicionales, en relacion con
   aquellas ya provocadas entre 1500 y 2005, causadas por el cambio en el
   uso de suelo para 2100 en todos los puntos clave, vario aproximadamente
   de 220 a 21, 000 (0.2\% a 16\%), dependiendo del escenario de mitigacion
   de cambio climatico y factores biologicos, como la pendiente de la
   relacion especies-area y la contribucion de la tala a las extinciones.
   Estas estimaciones de las extinciones potenciales en el futuro fueron
   causadas solamente por el cambio en el uso de suelo y probablemente
   habrian sido mas altas si se hubiesen considerado los efectos directos
   del cambio climatico. Las extinciones futuras podrian reducirse
   potencialmente al incorporar la preservacion del habitat al desarrollo
   del escenario para reducir los futuros cambios en el uso de suelo en los
   puntos clave o al disminuir el impacto de las futuras actividades de uso
   de suelo sobre la biodiversidad dentro de los puntos clave.

   Guadalupian-Lopingian/Capitanian-Wuchiapingian boundary is tentatively
   placed at the level of the Thirroul Sandstone in the lower part of the
   Illawarra Coal Measures in the Sydney Basin, The
   Wuchiapingian-Changhsingian boundary is at or close to the Kembla
   Sandstone horizon in the Illawarra Coal Measures, southern Sydney Basin,
   in the middle part of the Newcastle Coal Measures in the northern Sydney
   Basin, and in the middle of the Black Alley Shale in the southern Bowen
   Basin. The end-Permian mass extinction is recognised at the base of the
   Coal Cliff Sandstone in the southern Sydney Basin, at the top of the
   Newcastle Coal Measures in the northern Sydney Basin, and close to the
   base of the Rewan Group in the Bowen Basin and is dated at c. 252.2 Ma.
   The end-Permian mass extinction is interpreted to be synchronous
   globally in both marine and terrestrial environments, and in high and
   low latitudes (resolution <0.5 my). The GSSP-defined Permian-Triassic
   boundary is interpreted to be approximately at the level of the
   Scarborough Sandstone in the lower Narrabeen Group, Sydney Basin, and in
   the lower Rewan Group, Bowen Basin. New dates presented here suggest
   that the P3 and P4 glacial episodes in the Permian of eastern Australia
   are early Roadian to early Capitanian, and late Capitanian to mid
   Wuchiapingian in age respectively. The greenhouse crisis in the
   uppermost Pebbly Beach and Rowan Formations of the Sydney Basin is
   interpreted as early mid Roadian, a mid-Capitanian age for the crisis at
   the base of the Illawarra/Whittingham Coal Measures is confirmed.
   Greenhouse crises in the upper Illawarra/Newcastle Coal Measures and
   lower Narrabeen Group of the Sydney Basin are dated as upper
   Changhsingian-Induan, and in the upper Narrabeen Group/lower Hawksbury
   Sandstone as upper Olenekian. (C) 2014 International Association for

Title = {The Relative Impact of Climate Change on the Extinction Risk of Tree
   Species in the Montane Tropical Andes},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {There are widespread concerns that anthropogenic climate change will
   become a major cause of global biodiversity loss. However, the potential
   impact of climate change on the extinction risk of species remains
   poorly understood, particularly in comparison to other current threats.
   The objective of this research was to examine the relative impact of
   climate change on extinction risk of upper montane tree species in the
   tropical Andes, an area of high biodiversity value that is particularly
   vulnerable to climate change impacts. The extinction risk of 129 tree
   species endemic to the region was evaluated according to the IUCN Red
   List criteria, both with and without the potential impacts of climate
   change. Evaluations were supported by development of species
   distribution models, using three methods (generalized additive models,
   recursive partitioning, and support vector machines), all of which
   produced similarly high AUC values when averaged across all species
   evaluated (0.82, 0.86, and 0.88, respectively). Inclusion of climate
   change increased the risk of extinction of 18-20\% of the tree species
   evaluated, depending on the climate scenario. The relative impact of
   climate change was further illustrated by calculating the Red List
   Index, an indicator that shows changes in the overall extinction risk of
   sets of species over time. A 15\% decline in the Red List Index was
   obtained when climate change was included in this evaluation. While
   these results suggest that climate change represents a significant
   threat to tree species in the tropical Andes, they contradict previous
   suggestions that climate change will become the most important cause of
   biodiversity loss in coming decades. Conservation strategies should
   therefore focus on addressing the multiple threatening processes
   currently affecting biodiversity, rather than focusing primarily on
   potential climate change impacts.},

Title = {Expert opinion on extinction risk and climate change adaptation for
   biodiversity},
Journal = {ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Despite projections of biodiversity loss and proposed adaptations to
   climate change, few data exist on the feasibility and effectiveness of
   adaptation strategies in minimizing biodiversity loss. Given the urgent
   need for action, scientific experts can fill critical information gaps
   by providing rapid and discerning risk assessment. A survey of 2,329
   biodiversity experts projects, on average, that 9.5\% of species will
   become extinct due to climate change within the next 100 years. This
   average projection is low relative to previously published values but
   substantial in absolute terms, because it amounts to a loss of hundreds
   of thousands of species over the next century. The average projection
   increases to 21\% when experts are asked to estimate the percentage of
   species that will become extinct within the next 100 years due to
   climate change in combination with other causes. More than
   three-quarters of respondents reported being uncertain about their
   extinction estimates. A majority of experts preferred protected areas or
   corridors to reduce extinction risk but identified ex situ conservation
   and no intervention as the most feasible strategies. Experts also
   suggest that managed relocation of species, a particular adaptation
   strategy, is justifiable and effective in some situations but not
   others. Justifiable circumstances include the prevention of species
   extinction and overcoming human-made barriers to dispersal, and while
   experts are divided on the potential effectiveness of managed relocation
   for most taxonomic groups, higher percentages predict it effective for
   woody plants, terrestrial insects, and mammals. Most experts are open to
   the potential benefits of managed relocation but are concerned about
   unintended harmful consequences, particularly putting non-target species
   at risk of extinction. On balance, published biodiversity scientists
   feel that managed relocation, despite controversy about it, can be part
   of the conservation adaptation portfolio.},

Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {4},
Pages = {137-145},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Synergistic effect refers to simultaneous actions of separate factors
   which have a greater total effect than the sum of the individual factor
   effects. However, there has been a limited knowledge on how synergistic
   effects occur and individual roles of different drivers are not often
   considered. Therefore, it becomes quite challenging to manage multiple
   threatening processes simultaneously in order to mitigate biodiversity
   loss. In this regard, our hypothesis is, if the traits actually play
   different roles in the synergistic interaction, conservation efforts
   could be made more effectively. To understand the synergistic effect and
   test our hypothesis, we examined the processes associated with the
   endangerment of critically endangered Chinese Crested Tern (Thalasseus
   bernsteini), whose total population number was estimated no more than
   50. Through monitoring of breeding colonies and investigations into
   causative factors, combined with other data on human activities, we
   found that widespread human harvest of seabird eggs and increasing
   frequency of typhoons are the major factors that threatened the Chinese
   Crested Tern. Furthermore, 28 percent of breeding failures were due to
   the synergistic effects in which egg harvest-induced renestings suffered
   the higher frequent typhoons. In such combined interactions, the egg
   harvest has clearly served as a proximal factor for the population
   decline, and the superimposition of enhanced typhoon activity further
   accelerated the species toward imminent extinction. Our findings suggest
   that species endangerment, on one hand, should be treated as a
   synergistic process, while conservation efforts, on the other hand,
   should focus principally on combatting the threat that triggers
   synergistic effects. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {38},
Number = {5},
Pages = {510-519},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Climate change is expected to bring about profound rearrangement of
   ecological communities by affecting individual species distributions.
   The resulting communities arise from the idiosyncratic responses of
   species to future changes, which ultimately relate to both shrinking and
   expanding species ranges. While spatial patterns of colonisation and
   extirpation events have received great attention, the identification of
   specific drivers remains poorly explored. This study aims to investigate
   the relative contribution of species gain and loss to the turnover of
   fish assemblages in French rivers under future climate change, and to
   identify their principal drivers. Future projections of potential
   habitat suitability in 2080 derived from species distribution models for
   40 fish species showed that colonisations and extirpations could play
   counterbalancing roles in the reshuffling of communities.
   Simultaneously, these two processes exhibited patchy spatial patterns,
   segregated along the longitudinal and altitudinal gradients, resulting
   in dramatic species turnover of approximate to 60\% of the current
   composition of species assemblages. Beyond the effect of topographic
   location, colonisations were found to be driven by temperature
   seasonality while extirpations were affected by modifications in both
   thermal and precipitation regimes. These results generate the
   possibility of developing ecosystem-based management tools focused on
   the early identification of areas where particular species may be
   sensitive to climate changes. Disentangling the drivers of colonisation
   and extirpation processes provides ready-to-use information that may be
   easily integrated into conservation planning. This information could be
   used to identify potential hotspots of species gain and loss and to then
   compare these hotspots with newly favourable areas so as to consider

Abstract = {Aim The American pika (Ochotona princeps) appears to have experienced
   climate-mediated upslope range contraction in the Great Basin of North
   America, but this result has not yet been extended to other portions of
   the pika's range. Our goals were: first, to determine the environmental
   parameters that most influence current pika distribution within
   California; second, to infer whether these constraints explain
   extirpations that have occurred in California; third, to predict future
   extirpations; and fourth, to advance methods for assessing the degree to
   which pikas and other climate-sensitive mammals are threatened by
   climate change.
   Location Historical pika record locations in California, USA, spanning
   four degrees of latitude and longitude, from Mount Shasta to the
   southern Sierra Nevada.
   Methods We identified 67 precise historical pika record locations and
   surveyed them exhaustively, over multiple years, to determine whether
   pika populations persist at those sites. We used an information
   theoretic approach and logistic regression to model current pika
   occupancy as a function of 16 environmental variables, tested our
   best-performing model as a predictor of historical occupancy, and then
   used our model to predict future pika occupancy given anticipated
   climate change.
   Results Pikas no longer occurred at 10 of 67 (15\%) historical sites in
   California. The best predictors of occupancy were average summer
   temperature and talus habitat area within a 1-km radius. A logistic
   model fitted to this relationship correctly predicted current occupancy
   at 94\% of sites and correctly hindcasted past occupancy at 93\% of
   sites, suggesting that the model has strong temporal transferability.
   Depending on the future climate scenario, our model projects that by
   2070 pikas will be extirpated from 39\% to 88\% of these historical
   sites in California.
   Main conclusions Our simple species distribution model for pikas
   performs remarkably well for both current and historical periods. Pika
   distribution appears to be governed primarily by behavioural
   restrictions mediated by summer temperature and by the configuration of
   talus habitat available to pikas locally. Pikas, and other montane
   species in the western USA, may be subjected to above-average exposure
   to climate change because summer temperature is projected to rise more
   than annual temperature.},

Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1475-1481},

Abstract = {Species that inhabited Europe during the Late Quaternary were impacted
   by temperature changes and early humans, resulting in the disappearance
   of half of the European large mammals. However, quantifying the relative
   importance that each factor had in the extinction risk of species has
   been challenging, mostly due to the spatio-temporal biases of fossil
   records, which complicate the calibration of realistic and accurate
   ecological niche modeling. Here, we overcome this problem by using
   ecotypes, and not real species, to run our models. We created 40
   ecotypes with different temperature requirements (mean temperature from
   -20 degrees C to 25 degrees C and temperature range from 10 degrees C to
   40 degrees C) and used them to quantify the effect of climate change and
   human impact. Our results show that cold-adapted ecotypes would have
   been highly affected by past temperature changes in Europe, whereas
   temperate and warm-adapted ecotypes would have been positively affected
   by temperature change. Human impact affected all ecotypes negatively,
   and temperate ecotypes suffered the greatest impacts. Based on these
   results, the extinction of cold-adapted species like Mammuthus
   primigenius may be related to temperature change, while the extinction
   of temperate species, like Crocuta crocuta, may be related to human
   impact. Our results suggest that temperature change and human impact
   affected different ecotypes in distinct ways, and that the interaction
   of both impacts may have shaped species extinctions in Europe.},

Volume = {21},

Pages = {1066-1077},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Climate change is likely to become an increasingly major obstacle to
   slowing the rate of species extinctions. Several new assessment
   approaches have been proposed for identifying climate-vulnerable
   species, based on the assumption that established systems such as the
   IUCN Red List need revising or replacing because they were not developed
   to explicitly consider climate change. However, no assessment approach
   has been tested to determine its ability to provide advanced warning
   time for conservation action for species that might go extinct due to
   climate change. To test the performance of the Red List system in this
   capacity, we used linked niche-demographic models with habitat dynamics
   driven by a business-as-usual' climate change scenario. We generated
   replicate 100-year trajectories for range-restricted reptiles and
   amphibians endemic to the United States. For each replicate, we
   categorized the simulated species according to IUCN Red List criteria at
   annual, 5-year, and 10-year intervals (the latter representing current
   practice). For replicates that went extinct, we calculated warning time
   as the number of years the simulated species was continuously listed in
   a threatened category prior to extinction. To simulate data limitations,
   we repeated the analysis using a single criterion at a time
   (disregarding other listing criteria). Results show that when all
   criteria can be used, the Red List system would provide several decades
   of warning time (median=62years; >20years for 99\% of replicates), but
   suggest that conservation actions should begin as soon as a species is
   listed as Vulnerable, because 50\% of replicates went extinct within
   20years of becoming uplisted to Critically Endangered. When only one
   criterion was used, warning times were substantially shorter, but more
   frequent assessments increased the warning time by about a decade.
   Overall, we found that the Red List criteria reliably provide a
   sensitive and precautionary way to assess extinction risk under climate
   change.},

Abstract = {AimWe analyse the taxonomic status, phylogenetic relationships,

   mountaintops of the island of Mallorca (Spain). We also consider the
   potential impact of short-term climate change on the survival of this
   ant and make proposals on its conservation status, risks and management.
   LocationBalearic Islands (Spain).
   MethodsWe used morphological, molecular and ecological evidence to
   assess the specific status of the potential new species. We gathered
   distribution data to conduct climate-based distribution modelling of
   present and future occupancy under several SRES emission scenarios.
   ResultsThe existence of a new non-cryptic species of ant (Lasius
   balearicus Talavera, Espadaler \& Vila, sp. nov.) is described from the
   island of Mallorca. Its distribution was found to be extremely
   restricted (Serra de Tramuntana) and elevationally constrained to island
   summits (between 800 and 1400m a.s.l.). Molecular dating indicated that
   this species diverged about 1.51million years ago from its nearest
   relatives, from which it can be distinguished based on several
   morphological traits. Ecological niche modelling shows a dramatic
   reduction of areas with suitable climatic conditions under the different
   scenarios studied.
   Main conclusionsLasius balearicus represents the first endemic ant to be
   described in the Balearic Islands, as well as the first endemic Lasius
   species in the Mediterranean islands. Distribution modelling
   predictions, the low intraspecific genetic diversity observed, and the
   geographical and elevational isolation of the populations indicated a
   low probability for the survival of the species in the short term, thus
   making it a potential model to study real-time climate-based
   biodiversity loss. As a consequence, we strongly recommend including L.
   balearicus in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species under the category
   Endangered'. This case illustrates that a fraction of biodiversity
   remains unexplored even within Europe, arguably the best-studied region
   of the planet, and that the available time-window for us to study and
   protect it may be in some instances notably narrow.},

Volume = {5},
Month = {JAN 22},
Abstract = {We combined novel radiocarbon dates of bat fossils with time-scaled
   ecological niche models (ENM) to study bat extinctions in the Caribbean.
   Radiocarbon-dated fossils show that late Quaternary losses of bat
   populations took place during the late Holocene (<4 ka) rather than late
   Pleistocene (>10 ka). All bat radiocarbon dates from Abaco (Bahamas)
   that represent extirpated populations are younger than 4 ka. We include
   data on six bat species, three of which are Caribbean endemics, and
   include nectarivores as well as insectivores. Climate-based ENMs from
   the Last Glacial Maximum to the present reflect overall stability in
   distributions, with suitable climatic habitat being present over time.
   In the absence of radiocarbon dates, bat extinctions had been presumed
   to take place during the last glacial-interglacial transition (ca. 10
   ka). Now we see that extirpation of bats on these tropical islands is
   more complex than previously thought and primarily postdates the major
   climate changes that took place during the late Pleistocene-Holocene

Abstract = {Existing radiocarbon (C-14) dates on American mastodon (Mammut
   americanum) fossils from eastern Beringia (Alaska and Yukon) have been
   interpreted as evidence they inhabited the Arctic and Subarctic during
   Pleistocene full-glacial times (similar to 18,000 C-14 years B.P.).
   However, this chronology is inconsistent with inferred habitat
   preferences of mastodons and correlative paleoecological evidence. To
   establish a last appearance date (LAD) for M. americanum regionally, we
   obtained 53 new C-14 dates on 36 fossils, including specimens with
   previously published dates. Using collagen ultrafiltration and single
   amino acid (hydroxyproline) methods, these specimens consistently date
   to beyond or near the similar to 50,000 y B.P. limit of C-14 dating.
   Some erroneously ``young{''} C-14 dates are due to contamination by
   exogenous carbon from natural sources and conservation treatments used
   in museums. We suggest mastodons inhabited the high latitudes only
   during warm intervals, particularly the Last Interglacial {[}Marine
   Isotope Stage (MIS) 5] when boreal forests existed regionally. Our C-14
   dataset suggests that mastodons were extirpated from eastern Beringia
   during the MIS 4 glacial interval (similar to 75,000 y ago), following
   the ecological shift from boreal forest to steppe tundra. Mastodons
   thereafter became restricted to areas south of the continental ice
   sheets, where they suffered complete extinction similar to 10,000 C-14
   years B.P. Mastodons were already absent from eastern Beringia several
   tens of millennia before the first humans crossed the Bering Isthmus or
   the onset of climate changes during the terminal Pleistocene. Local
   extirpations of mastodons and other megafaunal populations in eastern
   Beringia were asynchrononous and independent of their final extinction
   south of the continental ice sheets.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {4},
Month = {NOV 4},
Abstract = {Predictive frameworks of climate change extinction risk generally focus
   on the magnitude of climate change a species is expected to experience
   and the potential for that species to track suitable climate. A species'
   risk of extinction from climate change will depend, in part, on the
   magnitude of climate change the species experiences, its exposure.
   However, exposure is only one component of risk. A species' risk of
   extinction will also depend on its intrinsic ability to tolerate
   changing climate, its sensitivity. We examine exposure and sensitivity
   individually for two example taxa, terrestrial amphibians and mammals.
   We examine how these factors are related among species and across
   regions and how explicit consideration of each component of risk may
   affect predictions of climate change impacts. We find that species'
   sensitivities to climate change are not congruent with their exposures.
   Many highly sensitive species face low exposure to climate change and
   many highly exposed species are relatively insensitive. Separating
   sensitivity from exposure reveals patterns in the causes and drivers of
   species' extinction risk that may not be evident solely from predictions
   of climate change. Our findings emphasise the importance of explicitly
   including sensitivity and exposure to climate change in assessments of
   species' extinction risk.},

   As minimal dispersal SDMs resulted in a stronger decline of future

Abstract = {The end-Permian mass extinction has been associated with severe global
   warming. Main stage volcanism of the Siberian Traps occurred at or near
   the extinction interval and has been proposed as a likely greenhouse
   catalyst. In this study, a high-resolution delta O-18 record is
   established using diagenetically resistant apatite of conodonts and
   low-Mg calcite of brachiopods from stratigraphically well-constrained
   Permian-Triassic (P-Tr) boundary successions in northwestern Iran. A new
   evaluation is made for previously published conodont delta O-18 values
   from South China and revised palaeotemperatures are presented together
   with new data from Wuchiapingian to Griesbachian sections in Iran. delta
   O-18 data from P-Tr sections in Iran document tropical sea surface
   temperatures (SST) of 27-33 degrees C during the Changhsingian with a
   negative shift in delta O-18 starting at the extinction horizon,
   translating into a warming of SSTs to over 35 degrees C. The results are
   consistent with re-calculated SSTs of the South Chinese sections.
   Warming was associated with an enhanced hydrological cycle involving
   increased tropical precipitation and monsoonal activity in the Tethys
   Sea. Global warming, intensification of the hydrological cycle and
   associated processes, vertical water column stratification,
   eutrophication and subsequent local anoxia may all have facilitated an

Abstract = {Over the next century, the conservation of biodiversity will depend not
   only on our ability to understand the effect of climate change, but also
   on our capacity to predict how other factors interact with climate
   change to influence species viability. We used American ginseng (Panax
   quinquefolius L.), the United States' premier wild-harvested medicinal,
   as a model system to ask whether the effect of harvest on extinction
   risk depends on changing climatic conditions. We performed stochastic
   projections of viability response to an increase in maximum
   growing-season temperature of 1 degrees C over the next 70 years by
   sampling matrices from long-term demographic studies of 12 populations
   (representing 75 population-years of data). In simulations that included
   harvest and climate change, extinction risk at the median population
   size (N = 140) was 65\%, far exceeding the additive effects of the two
   factors (extinction risk = 8\% and 6\% for harvest and climate change,
   respectively; quasi-extinction threshold = 20). We performed a life
   table response experiment (LTRE) to determine underlying causes of the
   effect of warming and harvest on deterministic lambda(lambda(d)).
   Together, these factors decreased lambda(d) values primarily by reducing
   growth of juvenile and small adult plants to the large-adult stage, as
   well as decreasing stasis of the juveniles and large adults. The
   interaction observed in stochastic model results followed from a
   nonlinear increase in extinction risk as the combined impact of harvest
   and warming consistently reduced lambda values below the demographic
   tipping point of lambda = 1. While further research is needed to create
   specific recommendations, these findings indicate that ginseng harvest
   regulations should be revised to account for changing climate. Given the
   possibility of nonlinear response like that reported here, pre-emptive
   adaptation of management strategies may increase efficacy of
   biodiversity conservation by allowing behavior modification prior to
   precipitous population decline.},

Abstract = {Many infectious agents transmitting through a contaminated environment
   are able to persist in the environment depending on the temperature and
   sanitation determined rates of their replication and clearance,
   respectively. There is a need to elucidate the effect of these factors
   on the infection transmission dynamics in terms of infection outbreaks
   and extinction while accounting for the random nature of the process.
   Also, it is important to distinguish between the true and apparent
   extinction, where the former means pathogen extinction in both the host
   and the environment while the latter means extinction only in the host
   population. This study proposes a stochastic-differential equation model
   as an approximation to a Markov jump process model, using Escherichia
   coli O157:H7 in cattle as a model system. In the model, the host
   population infection dynamics are described using the standard
   susceptible-infected-susceptible framework, and the E. coli O157:H7
   population in the environment is represented by an additional variable.
   The backward Kolmogorov equations that determine the probability
   distribution and the expectation of the first passage time are provided
   in a general setting. The outbreak and apparent extinction of infection
   are investigated by numerically solving the Kolmogorov equations for the
   probability density function of the associated process and the
   expectation of the associated stopping time. The results provide insight
   into E. coli O157:H7 transmission and apparent extinction, and suggest
   ways for controlling the spread of infection in a cattle herd.
   Specifically, this study highlights the importance of ambient
   temperature and sanitation, especially during summer.},

Abstract = {The late Quaternary megafauna extinction was a severe global-scale
   event. Two factors, climate change and modern humans, have received
   broad support as the primary drivers, but their absolute and relative
   importance remains controversial. To date, focus has been on the
   extinction chronology of individual or small groups of species, specific
   geographical regions or macroscale studies at very coarse geographical
   and taxonomic resolution, limiting the possibility of adequately testing
   the proposed hypotheses. We present, to our knowledge, the first global
   analysis of this extinction based on comprehensive country-level data on
   the geographical distribution of all large mammal species (more than or
   equal to 10 kg) that have gone globally or continentally extinct between
   the beginning of the Last Interglacial at 132 000 years BP and the late
   Holocene 1000 years BP, testing the relative roles played by
   glacial-interglacial climate change and humans. We show that the
   severity of extinction is strongly tied to hominin palaeobiogeography,
   with at most a weak, Eurasia-specific link to climate change. This first
   species-level macroscale analysis at relatively high geographical
   resolution provides strong support for modern humans as the primary
   driver of the worldwide megafauna losses during the late Quaternary.},

Abstract = {Developing conservation strategies for threatened species increasingly
   requires understanding vulnerabilities to climate change, in terms of
   both demographic sensitivities to climatic and other environmental
   factors, and exposure to variability in those factors over time and
   space. We conducted a range-wide, spatially explicit climate change
   vulnerability assessment for Eastern Massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus), a
   declining endemic species in a region showing strong environmental
   change. Using active season and winter adult survival estimates derived
   from 17 data sets throughout the species' range, we identified
   demographic sensitivities to winter drought, maximum precipitation
   during the summer, and the proportion of the surrounding landscape
   dominated by agricultural and urban land cover. Each of these factors
   was negatively associated with active season adult survival rates in
   binomial generalized linear models. We then used these relationships to
   back-cast adult survival with dynamic climate variables from 1950 to
   2008 using spatially explicit demographic models. Demographic models for
   189 population locations predicted known extant and extirpated
   populations well (AUC = 0.75), and models based on climate and land
   cover variables were superior to models incorporating either of those
   effects independently. These results suggest that increasing frequencies
   and severities of extreme events, including drought and flooding, have
   been important drivers of the long-term spatiotemporal variation in a
   demographic rate. We provide evidence that this variation reflects
   nonadaptive sensitivity to climatic stressors, which are contributing to
   long-term demographic decline and range contraction for a species of
   high-conservation concern. Range-wide demographic modeling facilitated
   an understanding of spatial shifts in climatic suitability and exposure,
   allowing the identification of important climate refugia for a
   dispersal-limited species. Climate change vulnerability assessment
   provides a framework for linking demographic and distributional dynamics
   to environmental change, and can thereby provide unique information for
   conservation planning and management.},

Title = {Detecting Extinction Risk from Climate Change by IUCN Red List Criteria},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {28},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change is a key threat to global biodiversity. To
   inform strategic actions aimed at conserving biodiversity as climate
   changes, conservation planners need early warning of the risks faced by
   different species. The IUCN Red List criteria for threatened species are
   widely acknowledged as useful risk assessment tools for informing
   conservation under constraints imposed by limited data. However, doubts
   have been expressed about the ability of the criteria to detect risks
   imposed by potentially slow-acting threats such as climate change,
   particularly because criteria addressing rates of population decline are
   assessed over time scales as short as 10 years. We used spatially
   explicit stochastic population models and dynamic species distribution
   models projected to future climates to determine how long before
   extinction a species would become eligible for listing as threatened
   based on the IUCN Red List criteria. We focused on a short-lived frog
   species (Assa darlingtoni) chosen specifically to represent potential
   weaknesses in the criteria to allow detailed consideration of the
   analytical issues and to develop an approach for wider application. The
   criteria were more sensitive to climate change than previously
   anticipated; lead times between initial listing in a threatened category
   and predicted extinction varied from 40 to 80 years, depending on data
   availability. We attributed this sensitivity primarily to the ensemble
   properties of the criteria that assess contrasting symptoms of
   extinction risk. Nevertheless, we recommend the robustness of the
   criteria warrants further investigation across species with contrasting
   life histories and patterns of decline. The adequacy of these lead times
   for early warning depends on practicalities of environmental policy and
   management, bureaucratic or political inertia, and the anticipated
   species response times to management actions. Deteccion del Riesgo de
   Extincion a partir del Cambio Climatico por medio del Criterio de la
   Lista Roja de la UICNKeith et al.
   Resumen El cambio climatico antropogenico es una amenaza clave para la
   biodiversidad global. Para informar a las acciones estrategicas
   dirigidas a la conservacion de la biodiversidad conforme cambia el
   clima, los planeadores de la conservacion necesitan advertencias
   tempranas de los riesgos enfrentados por especies diferentes. El
   criterio de la Lista Roja de la UICN para las especies amenazadas se
   reconoce ampliamente como una herramienta util de estudio de riesgo para
   informar a la conservacion bajo las restricciones impuestas por datos
   limitados. Sin embargo, se han expresado dudas sobre la habilidad del
   criterio para detectar riesgos impuestos por potenciales amenazas de
   accion lenta, como el cambio climatico, particularmente porque el
   criterio para dirigirse a las tasas de declinacion poblacional se
   estudian sobre escalas de tiempo tan cortas como 10 anos. Usamos modelos
   explicitamente espaciales de poblacion estocastica y modelos de
   dinamicas de distribucion de especies proyectados a climas futuros para
   determinar cuanto tiempo antes de la extincion una especie seria
   elegible para enlistarse como amenazada basandonos en el criterio de la
   Lista Roja de la UICN. Nos enfocamos en una especie de rana de vida
   corta (Assa darlingtoni) escogida especificamente para representar las
   debilidades potenciales en el criterio para permitir la consideracion
   detallada de los problemas analiticos y para desarrollar un acercamiento
   de aplicacion mayor. El criterio fue mas sensible al cambio climatico
   que como se anticipo previamente; los tiempos mayores entre el listado
   inicial en una categoria de amenaza y la extincion predicha vario entre
   40 y 80 anos, dependiendo de la disponibilidad de datos. Atribuimos esta
   sensibilidad principalmente a las propiedades conjuntas del criterio que
   estudian sintomas contrastantes del riesgo de extincion. Sin embargo,
   recomendamos que lo robusto del criterio garantiza una investigacion mas
   detallada sobre las especies con historias de vida contrastantes y
   patrones de declinacion. La adecuacion de estos tiempos mayores para una
   alerta temprana depende de lo practico de la politica ambiental y el
   manejo, la inercia politica o burocratica y la respuesta anticipada de
   las especies a las acciones de manejo.},

Abstract = {Extinction limits of counterflow non-premixed flames with normal and
   high temperature oxidizers were studied experimentally and numerically
   for development of new-type oxygen-enriched mild combustion furnace.
   Extinction stretch rates of CH4/CO2 (at 300 K) versus O-2/CO2 flames at
   oxygen mole fractions of 0.35 and 0.40 and oxidizer temperatures of 300
   K, 500 K, 700 K and 1000 K were obtained. Investigation was also
   conducted for CH4/N-2 (at 300 K) versus air (O-2/N-2) flames at the same
   oxidizer temperatures. An effect of radiative heat loss on stretch
   extinction limits of oxygen-enriched flames and air flames was
   investigated by computations with optical thin model (OTM) and adiabatic
   flame model (ADI). The results show influence of radiative heat loss on
   stretch extinction limits was not significant in relative high fuel mole
   fraction regions. The extinction curve of the oxygen-enriched flames
   with oxygen mole fraction of 0.35 was close to that of the air flames at
   the oxidizer temperature of 300 K. However, the extinction curve of air
   flames with high temperature oxidizer was comparable with that of
   oxygen-enriched flames with oxygen mole fraction of 0.40. Scaling
   analysis based on asymptotic solution of stretch extinction was applied
   and it was found that stretch extinction limits can be expressed by two
   terms. The first term is total enthalpy flux of fuel stream based on
   thermo-physical parameters. The second term is a kinetic term which
   reflects an effect of the chemical reaction rate on stretch extinction
   limits. OH radicals which play important roles in chain propagating and
   main endothermic reactions were used to represent the kinetic term of
   both oxygen-enriched and air flames. The global rates of OH formation in
   these two cases were compared to understand the contribution of kinetic
   term to stretch extinction limits. Variation of extinction curves of
   oxygen-enriched flames and air flames was well explained by the present
   scaling analysis. This offers an effective approach to estimate stretch
   extinction limits of oxygen-enriched flames based on those of air flames
   at the same oxidizer temperature. (C) 2013 The Combustion Institute.

Abstract = {The end-Permian mass extinction event was the greatest loss of
   biodiversity ever experienced on the planet. The event is thought to
   have been triggered by the initiation of the volcanic eruptions of the
   Siberian Traps. The five million year recovery interval that followed
   the extinction event was strongly influenced by the environmental
   effects of sustained volcanic eruptions including extreme temperature
   events and persistent global and regional oxygen minimum zones. The
   effects of these environmental perturbations on the paleoecological
   recovery of the benthic marine fauna were studied in two depositional
   units from the Southwestern United States representing two substages
   during the Early Triassic recovery. The Smithian Sinbad Limestone was
   influenced by high sea surface temperatures and contains a relatively
   high diversity fauna that exhibits extremely small body size. Gastropods
   that lived in this environment were size-limited, a possible result of
   metabolic stress due to extreme temperatures. These microgastropods were
   able to become dominate components of the benthic fauna by occupying
   niche space vacated by other taxa that were excluded by high
   temperatures. The Spathian Virgin Limestone shows evidence for low
   oxygen conditions. The resulting low diversity benthic fauna had a more
   ecologically complex community structure than the Smithian Sinbad
   Limestone including the occupation of epifaunal tiering space by
   crinoids. As the prevalence of aerobic facies increased through time,
   diversity, body size, and the complexity of faunal interactions also
   increased suggesting that low oxygen conditions were the limiting factor
   for the benthic recovery in that region. The differences in diversity
   and community structure between the two units highlight the importance
   of environmental and temporal differences in driving the recovery
   patterns of the benthic fauna following the extinction event. High
   temperature events and low oxygen conditions restricted the benthic
   fauna in different ways but both contributed to the delay in recovery
   from the end-Permian mass extinction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {There is an urgent need to develop effective vulnerability assessments
   for evaluating the conservation status of species in a changing
   climate(1). Several new assessment approaches have been proposed for
   evaluating the vulnerability of species to climate change(2-5) based on
   the expectation that established assessments such as the IUCN Red
   List(6) need revising or superseding in light of the threat that climate
   change brings. However, although previous studies have identified
   ecological and life history attributes that characterize declining
   species or those listed as threatened(7-9), no study so far has
   undertaken a quantitative analysis of the attributes that cause species
   to be at high risk of extinction specifically due to climate change. We
   developed a simulation approach based on generic life history types to
   show here that extinction risk due to climate change can be predicted
   using a mixture of spatial and demographic variables that can be
   measured in the present day without the need for complex forecasting
   models. Most of the variables we found to be important for predicting
   extinction risk, including occupied area and population size, are
   already used in species conservation assessments, indicating that
   present systems may be better able to identify species vulnerable to
   climate change than previously thought. Therefore, although climate
   change brings many new conservation challenges, we find that it may not
   be fundamentally different from other threats in terms of assessing
   extinction risks.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 23},
Abstract = {The loss of species is known to have significant effects on ecosystem
   functioning, but only recently has it been recognized that species loss
   might rival the effects of other forms of environmental change on
   ecosystem processes. There is a need for experimental studies that
   explicitly manipulate species richness and environmental factors
   concurrently to determine their relative impacts on key ecosystem
   processes such as plant litter decomposition. It is crucial to
   understand what factors affect the rate of plant litter decomposition
   and the relative magnitude of such effects because the rate at which
   plant litter is lost and transformed to other forms of organic and
   inorganic carbon determines the capacity for carbon storage in
   ecosystems and the rate at which greenhouse gasses such as carbon
   dioxide are outgassed. Here we compared how an increase in water
   temperature of 5 degrees C and loss of detritivorous invertebrate and
   plant litter species affect decomposition rates in a laboratory
   experiment simulating stream conditions. Like some prior studies, we
   found that species identity, rather than species richness per se, is a
   key driver of decomposition, but additionally we showed that the loss of
   particular species can equal or exceed temperature change in its impact
   on decomposition. Our results indicate that the loss of particular
   species can be as important a driver of decomposition as substantial
   temperature change, but also that predicting the relative consequences
   of species loss and other forms of environmental change on decomposition
   requires knowledge of assemblages and their constituent species' ecology
   and ecophysiology.},

Abstract = {This review includes a broad, but superficial, summary of our
   understanding about current and future climate changes, the predictions
   about how these changes will likely affect the risks of extinction of
   organisms, and how current climate changes are already affecting
   reproduction in terrestrial vertebrates. Many organisms have become
   extinct in the last century, but habitat destruction, disease and
   man-made factors other than climate change have been implicated as the
   causal factor in almost all of these. Reproduction is certain to be
   negatively impacted in all vertebrate groups for a variety of reasons,
   such as direct thermal and hydric effects on mortality of embryos,
   mismatches between optimal availability of food supplies, frequently
   determined by temperature, and reproductive capacities, sometimes
   determined by rigid factors such as photoperiod, and disappearance of
   appropriate foraging opportunities, such as melting sea ice. The numbers
   of studies documenting correlations between climate changes and
   biological phenomena are rapidly increasing, but more direct information
   about the consequences of these changes for species survival and
   ecosystem health is needed than is currently available.},

Title = {Extinction in Eden: identifying the role of climate change in the
   decline of the koala in south-eastern NSW},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {22-34},
Abstract = {Context. Reviews of climate change in Australia have identified that it
   is imposing additional stresses on biodiversity, which is already under
   threat from multiple human impacts.
   Aims. The present study aimed to determine the contributions of several
   factors to the demise of the koala in the Eden region in south-eastern
   New South Wales and, in particular, to establish to what extent climate
   change may have exacerbated the decline.
   Methods. The study built on several community-based koala surveys in the
   Eden region since 1986, verified through interviews with survey
   respondents. Historical records as far back as the late 19th century,
   wildlife databases and field-based surveys were used to independently
   validate the community survey data and form a reliable picture of
   changes in the Eden koala population. Analysis of the community survey
   data used a logistic model to assess the contribution of known threats
   to koalas, including habitat loss measured as changes in foliage
   projective cover, fire, increases in the human population and climate
   change in the form of changes in temperature and rainfall, to the
   regional decline of this species.
   Key results. We found a marked, long-term shrinkage in the distribution
   of the koala across the Eden region. Our modelling demonstrated that a
   succession of multiple threats to koalas from land use (human population
   growth and habitat loss) and environmental change (temperature increase
   and drought) were significant contributors to this decline.
   Conclusions. Climate change, particularly drought and rising
   temperatures, has been a hitherto hidden factor that has been a major
   driver of the decline of the koala in the Eden region.
   Implications. Development of strategies to help fauna adapt to the
   changing climate is of paramount importance, particularly at a local
   scale.},

Abstract = {Many marine invertebrate species facing potential extinction have
   uncertain taxonomies and poorly known demographic and ecological traits.
   Uncertainties are compounded when potential extinction drivers are
   climate and ocean changes whose effects on even widespread and abundant
   species are only partially understood. The U.S. Endangered Species Act
   mandates conservation management decisions founded on the extinction
   risk to species based on the best available science at the time of
   considerationrequiring prompt action rather than awaiting better
   information. We developed an expert-opinion threat-based approach that
   entails a structured voting system to assess extinction risk from
   climate and ocean changes and other threats to 82 coral species for
   which population status and threat response information was limited.
   Such methods are urgently needed because constrained budgets and
   manpower will continue to hinder the availability of desired data for
   many potentially vulnerable marine species. Significant species-specific
   information gaps and uncertainties precluded quantitative assessments of
   habitat loss or population declines and necessitated increased reliance
   on demographic characteristics and threat vulnerabilities at genus or
   family levels. Adapting some methods (e.g., a structured voting system)
   used during other assessments and developing some new approaches (e.g.,
   integrated assessment of threats and demographic characteristics), we
   rated the importance of threats contributing to coral extinction risk
   and assessed those threats against population status and trend
   information to evaluate each species' extinction risk over the 21st
   century. This qualitative assessment resulted in a ranking with an
   uncertainty range for each species according to their estimated
   likelihood of extinction. We offer guidance on approaches for future
   biological extinction risk assessments, especially in cases of
   data-limited species likely to be affected by global-scale threats.},

Abstract = {Global warming affects ecosystems and species' diversity. The physiology
   of individual species is highly influenced by changes in temperature.
   The effects on species communities are less studied; they are virtually
   unknown when combining effects of pollution and temperature. To assess
   the effects of temperature and pollution in the soil community, a
   2-factorial soil mesocosms multispecies experiment was performed. Three
   exposure periods (28 d, 61 d, and 84 d) and 4 temperatures (19 degrees
   C, 23 degrees C, 26 degrees C, and 29 degrees C) were tested, resembling
   the mean annual values for southern Europe countries and extreme events.
   The soil used was from a field site, clean, or spiked with Cu (100mg
   Cu/kg). Results showed clear differences between 29 degrees C treatment
   and all other temperature treatments, with a decrease in overall
   abundance of organisms, further potentiated by the increase in exposure
   time. Folsomia candida was the most abundant species and Enchytraeus
   crypticus was the most sensitive to Cu toxicity. Differences in species
   optimum temperatures were adequately covered: 19 degrees C for Hypoaspis
   aculeifer or 26 degrees C for E. crypticus. The temperature effects were
   more pronounced the longer the exposure time. Feeding activity decreased
   with higher temperature and exposure time, following the decrease in
   invertebrate abundance, whereas for the same conditions the organic
   matter turnover increased. Hence, negative impacts on ecosystem services
   because of temperature increase can be expected by changes on soil
   function and as consequence of biodiversity loss. Environ Toxicol Chem

Title = {Climate Change and Human Disturbance Can Lead to Local Extinction of
   Alpine Rock Ptarmigan: New Insight from the Western Italian Alps},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 19},
Abstract = {Alpine grouses are particularly vulnerable to climate change due to
   their adaptation to extreme conditions and to their relict distributions
   in the Alps where global warming has been particularly marked in the
   last half century. Grouses are also currently threatened by habitat
   modification and human disturbance, and an assessment of the impact of
   multiple stressors is needed to predict the fate of Alpine populations
   of these birds in the next decades. We estimated the effect of climate
   change and human disturbance on a rock ptarmigan population living in
   the western Italian Alps by combining an empirical population modelling
   approach and stochastic simulations of the population dynamics under the
   a1B climate scenario and two different disturbance scenarios,
   represented by the development of a ski resort, through 2050. The early
   appearance of snow-free ground in the previous spring had a favorable
   effect on the rock ptarmigan population, probably through a higher
   reproductive success. On the contrary, delayed snowfall in autumn had a
   negative effect possibly due to a mismatch in time to molt to white
   winter plumage which increases predation risk. The regional climate
   model PROTHEUS does not foresee any significant change in snowmelt date
   in the study area, while the start date of continuous snow cover is
   expected to be significantly delayed. The net effect in the stochastic
   projections is a more or less pronounced (depending on the model used)
   decline in the studied population. The addition of extra-mortality due
   to collision with ski-lift wires led the population to fatal
   consequences in most projections. Should these results be confirmed by
   larger studies the conservation of Alpine populations would deserve more
   attention. To counterbalance the effects of climate change, the
   reduction of all causes of death should be pursued, through a strict
   preservation of the habitats in the present area of occurrence.},

Abstract = {The early Toarcian extinction event, once regarded as spanning in the
   late Pliensbachian-early Toarcian boundary period, actually occurred in
   two distinct phases in the early Toarcian of the Iberian Range. The
   first episode occurred in the Mirabile Subzone, Tenuicostatum Zone and
   is characterised by the disappearance of about 12\% of ostracod species
   and one suborder, the Metacopina (Superfamily Healdioidea). This. study
   shows that this suborder disappears during stratigraphical intervals
   that are considered to be representative of low oxygen conditions in the
   Iberian Range. The collapse of marine ecosystems (affecting up to 40\%
   of ostracod species) in the Elegantulum Subzone, Serpentinum Zone was
   most likely triggered by a sudden and widespread lethal increase in
   seawater temperature. These combined processes of oxygenation and
   temperature change are considered to be responsible for the profound
   changes in marine environments that resulted in the early Toarcian
   ostracod extinction in the Iberian Range. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Respiratory evaporative cooling is an important mechanism of temperature
   control in bird. A computational simulation of the breathing cycle, heat
   and water loss in anatomical avian trachea/air sac model has not

   breathing cycle in a three-dimensional model of avian trachea and air
   sacs (domestic fowl) using transient computational fluid dynamics. The
   airflow in the trachea of the model is evoked by changing the volume of
   the air sacs based on the measured tidal volume and
   inspiratory/expiratory times for the domestic fowl. We compare flow
   parameters and heat transfer results with in vivo data and with our
   previously reported results for a two-dimensional model. The total
   respiratory heat loss corresponds to about 13-19\% of the starvation
   metabolic rate of domestic fowl. The present study can lend insight into
   a possible thermoregulatory function in species with long necks and/or a
   very long trachea, as found in swans and birds of paradise. Assuming the
   structure of the sauropod dinosaur respiratory system was close to
   avian, the simulation of the respiratory temperature control (using

Title = {A scenario for impacts of water availability loss due to climate change
   on riverine fish extinction rates},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {50},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1105-1115},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {1. Current models estimating impact of habitat loss on biodiversity in
   the face of global climate change usually project only percentages of
   species committed to extinction' on an uncertain time-scale. Here, we
   show that this limitation can be overcome using an empirically derived
   background extinction rate-area' curve to estimate natural rates and
   project future rates of freshwater fish extinction following variations
   in river drainage area resulting from global climate change.
   2. Based on future climatic projections, we quantify future active
   drainage basin area losses and combine them with the extinction
   rate-area curve to estimate the future change in extinction rate for
   each river basin. We then project the number of extinct species in each
   river basin using a global data base of freshwater fish species
   richness.
   3. The median projected extinction rate owing to climate change
   conditions is c. 7\% higher than the median background extinction rate.
   A closer look at the pattern reveals great geographical variations
   highlighting an amplification of aridity by 2090 and subsequent increase
   in extinction rates in presently semi-arid and Mediterranean regions.
   Among the 10\% most-impacted drainage basins, water availability loss
   will increase background extinction rates by 18.2 times (median value).
   4. Projected numbers of extinct species by 2090 show that only 20 river
   basins among the 1010 analysed would experience fish species extinctions
   attributable to water availability loss from climate change. Predicted
   numbers of extinct species for these rivers range from 1 to 5.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results strongly contrast with
   previous alarming predictions of huge surface-dependent climate
   change-driven extinctions for riverine fishes and other taxonomic
   groups. Furthermore, based on well-documented fish extinctions from
   Central and North American drainages over the last century, we also show
   that recent extinction rates are, on average, 130 times greater than our
   projected extinction rates from climate change. This last result implies
   that current anthropogenic threats generate extinction rates in rivers
   far greater than the ones expected from future water availability loss.
   We thus argue that conservation actions should be preferentially focused
   on reducing the impacts of present-day anthropogenic drivers of riverine
   fish extinctions.},

Abstract = {Ecological niche models (ENMs) are the primary tool used to describe and
   forecast the potential influence of climate change on biodiversity.
   However, ENMs do not directly account for important biological and
   landscape processes likely to affect range dynamics at a variety of
   spatial scales. Recent advances to link ENMs with population models have
   focused on the fundamental step of integrating dispersal and
   metapopulation dynamics into forecasts of species geographic ranges.
   Here we use a combination of novel analyses and a synthesis of findings
   from published plant and animal case studies to highlight three seldom
   recognised, yet important, advantages of linking ENMs with demographic
   modelling approaches: 1) they provide direct measures of extinction risk
   in addition to measures of vulnerability based on change in the
   potential range area or total habitat suitability. 2) They capture
   life-history traits that permit population density to vary in different
   ways in response to key spatial drivers, conditioned by the processes of
   global change. 3) They can be used to explore and rank the cost
   effectiveness of regional conservation alternatives and demographically
   oriented management interventions. Given these advantages, we argue that
   coupled methods should be used preferentially where data permits and
   when conservation management decisions require intervention,
   prioritization, or direct estimates of extinction risk.},

Abstract = {The current distributions of species are often assumed to correspond

   current distributions alters extinction risks, time lags in realizing
   those risks, and the usefulness of alternative management strategies. To
   inform these issues, we propose a conceptual framework within which
   empirical data could be used to generate hypotheses regarding the
   realized, fundamental, and `tolerance' niche of species. Although these
   niche components have rarely been characterized over geographic scales,
   we suggest that this could be done for many plant species by comparing

Abstract = {Aim As the global climate is changing rapidly, there is a need to make
   conservation decisions to facilitate species' persistence under climate
   change. Models employed to make predictions regarding the impacts of
   climate change on species' distributions, and ultimately persistence,
   typically assume that interannual variability in environmental
   conditions is independent between years. However, the colour of
   environmental noise has been shown to affect extinction risk in
   populations occupying spatially static environments, and should
   therefore affect persistence during climate change. This study aims to
   investigate the importance of noise colour for extinction risk during
   climate-induced range shifts. Methods We use a spatially explicit
   coupled map lattice with a latitudinal gradient in climatic suitability,
   together with time series of environmental noise, to simulate periods of
   directional climate change and investigate the effects of noise colour
   on extinction risk and range size. Results Extinction risk increases
   with reddening of the environmental noise, and this effect is
   particularly pronounced over short time frames when climate change is
   rapid. Main conclusions Given that management decisions are typically
   made over such short time frames, and the rapid rates of climate change
   currently being experienced, we highlight the importance of
   incorporating realistic time series of environmental noise into models
   used for conservation planning under climate change.},

Abstract = {Around 88 large vertebrate taxa disappeared from Sahul sometime during
   the Pleistocene, with the majority of losses (54 taxa) clearly taking
   place within the last 400,000 years. The largest was the 2.8-ton
   browsing Diprotodon optatum, whereas the similar to 100- to 130-kg
   marsupial lion, Thylacoleo carnifex, the world's most specialized
   mammalian carnivore, and Varanus priscus, the largest lizard known, were
   formidable predators. Explanations for these extinctions have centered
   on climatic change or human activities. Here, we review the evidence and
   arguments for both. Human involvement in the disappearance of some
   species remains possible but unproven. Mounting evidence points to the
   loss of most species before the peopling of Sahul (circa 50-45 ka) and a
   significant role for climate change in the disappearance of the
   continent's megafauna.},

Abstract = {Aim To quantify the consequences of major threats to biodiversity, such
   as climate and land-use change, it is important to use explicit measures
   of species persistence, such as extinction risk. The extinction risk of
   metapopulations can be approximated through simple models, providing a
   regional snapshot of the extinction probability of a species. We
   evaluated the extinction risk of three species under different climate
   change scenarios in three different regions of the Mexican cloud forest,
   a highly fragmented habitat that is particularly vulnerable to climate
   change. Location Cloud forests in Mexico. Methods Using Maxent, we
   estimated the potential distribution of cloud forest for three different
   time horizons (2030, 2050 and 2080) and their overlap with protected
   areas. Then, we calculated the extinction risk of three contrasting
   vertebrate species for two scenarios: (1) climate change only (all
   suitable areas of cloud forest through time) and (2) climate and
   land-use change (only suitable areas within a currently protected area),
   using an explicit patch-occupancy approximation model and calculating
   the joint probability of all populations becoming extinct when the
   number of remaining patches was less than five. Results Our results show
   that the extent of environmentally suitable areas for cloud forest in
   Mexico will sharply decline in the next 70years. We discovered that if
   all habitat outside protected areas is transformed, then only species
   with small area requirements are likely to persist. With habitat loss
   through climate change only, high dispersal rates are sufficient for
   persistence, but this requires protection of all remaining cloud forest
   areas. Main conclusions Even if high dispersal rates mitigate the
   extinction risk of species due to climate change, the synergistic
   impacts of changing climate and land use further threaten the
   persistence of species with higher area requirements. Our approach for
   assessing the impacts of threats on biodiversity is particularly useful
   when there is little time or data for detailed population viability
   analyses.},

Abstract = {The effect of the initial temperature of a porous carbon particle on the
   characteristics of its combustion and spontaneous extinction is analyzed
   taking into account Stefan flow and heat loss by radiation. It is shown
   that in the case of forced ignition (increase in the initial temperature

   spontaneous extinction remain virtually unchanged. As a result, the
   extinguished particles have the same diameter but different density. It
   is shown that the dependence of particle diameter on stationary
   temperature can be used to determine the maximum combustion temperature
   and diameter of the particle during its spontaneous extinction. The
   effect of oxygen concentration on the region of ignition of a porous
   carbon particle, determined by the initial diameter and temperature of
   the particle, is analyzed. Analysis of the diffusion-kinetic relations
   shows that each of the two main heterogeneous reactions of carbon
   oxidation make similar contributions to the heat and mass transfer of

Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {The Department of Meteorology at Stockholm University operates the
   Esrange Rayleigh/Raman lidar at Esrange (68 degrees N, 21 degrees E)
   near the Swedish city of Kiruna. This paper describes the design and
   first measurements of the new pure rotational-Raman channel of the
   Esrange lidar. The Esrange lidar uses a pulsed Nd:YAG solid-state laser
   operating at 532 nm as light source with a repetition rate of 20 Hz and
   a pulse energy of 350 mJ. The minimum vertical resolution is 150 m and
   the integration time for one profile is 5000 shots. The newly
   implemented channel allows for measurements of atmospheric temperature
   at altitudes below 35 km and is currently optimized for temperature
   measurements between 180 and 200 K. This corresponds to conditions in
   the lower Arctic stratosphere during winter. In addition to the
   temperature measurements, the aerosol extinction coefficient and the
   aerosol backscatter coefficient at 532 urn can be measured
   independently. Our filter-based design minimizes the systematic error in
   the obtained temperature profile to less than 0.51 K. By combining
   rotational-Raman measurements (5-35 km height) and the integration
   technique (30-80 km height), the Esrange lidar is now capable of
   measuring atmospheric temperature profiles from the upper troposphere up
   to the mesosphere. With the improved setup, the system can be used to
   validate current lidar-based polar stratospheric cloud classification
   schemes. The new capability of the instrument measuring temperature and
   aerosol extinction furthermore enables studies of the thermal structure
   and variability of the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere. Although
   several lidars are operated at polar latitudes, there are few
   instruments that are capable of measuring temperature profiles in the
   troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere, as well as aerosols
   extinction in the troposphere and lower stratosphere with daylight
   capability.},

Abstract = {Shell calcification in argonauts is unique. Only females of these
   cephalopods construct the paper nautilus shell, which is used as a brood
   chamber for developing embryos in the pelagic realm. As one of the
   thinnest (225 mu m) known adult mollusc shells, and lacking an outer
   protective periostracum-like cover, this shell may be susceptible to
   dissolution as the ocean warms and decreases in pH. Vulnerability of the
   A. nodosa shell was investigated through immersion of shell fragments in
   multifactorial experiments of control (19 degrees C/pH 8.1; pCO(2) 419;
   Omega(Ca) = 4.23) and near-future conditions (24 degrees C/pH 7.8-7.6;
   pCO(2) 932-1525; Omega(Ca) = 2.72-1.55) for 14 days. More extreme pH
   treatments (pH 7.4-7.2; pCO(2) 2454-3882; Omega(Ca) = 1.20-0.67) were
   used to assess tipping points in shell dissolution. X-ray diffractometry
   revealed no change in mineralogy between untreated and treated shells.
   Reduced shell weight due to dissolution was evident in shells incubated
   at pH 7.8 (projected for 2070) after 14 days at control temperature,
   with increased dissolution in warmer and lower pH treatments. The
   greatest dissolution was recorded at 24 degrees C (projected for local
   waters by 2100) compared to control temperature across all low-pH
   treatments. Scanning electron microscopy revealed dissolution and
   etching of shell mineral in experimental treatments. In the absence of
   compensatory mineralization, the uncovered female brood chamber will be
   susceptible to dissolution as ocean pH decreases. Since the shell was a
   crucial adaptation for the evolution of the argonauts' holopelagic
   existence, persistence of A. nodosa may be compromised by shell
   dissolution in an ocean-change world.},

Abstract = {Quantitative estimates of the range loss of mountain plants under
   climate change have so far mostly relied on static geographical
   projections of species' habitat shifts(1-3). Here, we use a hybrid
   model(4) that combines such projections with simulations of demography
   and seed dispersal to forecast the climate-driven spatio-temporal
   dynamics of 150 high-mountain plant species across the European Alps.
   This model predicts average range size reductions of 44-50\% by the end
   of the twenty-first century, which is similar to projections from the
   most `optimistic' static model (49\%). However, the hybrid model also
   indicates that population dynamics will lag behind climatic trends and
   that an average of 40\% of the range still occupied at the end of the
   twenty-first century will have become climatically unsuitable for the
   respective species, creating an extinction debt(5,6). Alarmingly,
   species endemic to the Alps seem to face the highest range losses. These
   results caution against optimistic conclusions from moderate range size
   reductions observed during the twenty-first century as they are likely
   to belie more severe longer-term effects of climate warming on mountain

   multiple competing species along awarming climatic gradient that
   includes temperature-dependent competition, differences in niche breadth
   and interspecific differences in dispersal ability. Competition and
   dispersal differences decreased diversity and produced so-called
   `no-analogue' communities, defined as a novel combination of species
   that does not currently co-occur. Climate change altered community
   richness the most when species had narrow niches, when mean
   community-wide dispersal rates were low and when species differed in
   dispersal abilities. With high interspecific dispersal variance, the
   best dispersers tracked climate change, out-competed slower dispersers
   and caused their extinction. Overall, competition slowed the advance of
   colonists into newly suitable habitats, creating lags in climate
   tracking. We predict that climate change will most threaten communities
   of species that have narrow niches (e. g. tropics), vary in dispersal
   (most communities) and compete strongly. Current forecasts probably

Abstract = {Selectivity patterns provide insights into the causes of ancient
   extinction events. The Late Ordovician mass extinction was related to
   Gondwanan glaciation; however, it is still unclear whether elevated
   extinction rates were attributable to record failure, habitat loss, or
   climatic cooling. We examined Middle Ordovician-Early Silurian North
   American fossil occurrences within a spatiotemporally explicit
   stratigraphic framework that allowed us to quantify rock record effects
   on a per-taxon basis and assay the interplay of macrostratigraphic and
   macroecological variables in determining extinction risk. Genera that
   had large proportions of their observed geographic ranges affected by
   stratigraphic truncation or environmental shifts at the end of the
   Katian stage were particularly hard hit. The duration of the subsequent
   sampling gaps had little effect on extinction risk, suggesting that this
   extinction pulse cannot be entirely attributed to rock record failure;
   rather, it was caused, in part, by habitat loss. Extinction risk at this
   time was also strongly influenced by the maximum paleolatitude at which
   a genus had previously been sampled, a macroecological trait linked to
   thermal tolerance. A model trained on the relationship between 16
   explanatory variables and extinction patterns during the early Katian
   interval substantially underestimates the extinction of exclusively
   tropical taxa during the late Katian interval. These results indicate
   that glacioeustatic sea-level fall and tropical ocean cooling played
   important roles in the first pulse of the Late Ordovician mass
   extinction in Laurentia.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic global climate change has already led to alterations in
   biodiversity patterns by directly and indirectly affecting species
   distributions. It has been suggested that poikilothermic animals,
   including reptiles, will be particularly affected by global change and
   large-scale reptile declines have already been observed. Currently, half
   of the world's freshwater turtles and tortoises are considered
   threatened with extinction, and climate change may exacerbate these
   declines. In this study, we assess how global chelonian species richness
   will change in the near future. We use species distribution models
   developed under current climate conditions for 78\% of all extant
   species and project them onto different Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios for 2080. We detect a strong dependence
   of temperature shaping most species ranges, which coincide with their
   general temperature-related physiological traits (i.e.,
   temperature-dependent sex determination). Furthermore, the extent and
   distribution of the current bioclimatic niches of most chelonians may
   change remarkably in the near future, likely leading to a substantial
   decrease of local species abundance and ultimately a reduction in
   species richness. Future climatic changes may cause the ranges of 86\%
   of the species to contract, and of these ranges, nearly 12\% are

Abstract = {Models that couple habitat suitability with demographic processes offer
   a potentially improved approach for estimating spatial distributional
   shifts and extinction risk under climate change. Applying such an
   approach to five species of Australian plants with contrasting
   demographic traits, we show that: (i) predicted climate-driven changes
   in range area are sensitive to the underlying habitat model, regardless
   of whether demographic traits and their interaction with habitat patch
   configuration are modeled explicitly; and (ii) caution should be
   exercised when using predicted changes in total habitat suitability or
   geographic extent to infer extinction risk, because the relationship
   between these metrics is often weak. Measures of extinction risk, which
   quantify threats to population persistence, are particularly sensitive
   to life-history traits, such as recruitment response to fire, which
   explained approximately 60\% of the deviance in expected minimum
   abundance. Dispersal dynamics and habitat patch structure have the
   strongest influence on the amount of movement of the trailing and
   leading edge of the range margin, explaining roughly 40\% of modeled
   structural deviance. These results underscore the need to consider
   direct measures of extinction risk (population declines and other
   measures of stochastic viability), as well as measures of change in
   habitat area, when assessing climate change impacts on biodiversity.
   Furthermore, direct estimation of extinction risk incorporates important
   demographic and ecosystem processes, which potentially influence species
   vulnerability to extinction due to climate change.},

Title = {Did central Australian megafaunal extinction coincide with abrupt
   ecosystem collapse or gradual climate change?},

Year = {2012},

Abstract = {Aim In central Australia, the giant flightless bird Genyornis newtoni
   disappeared about 4550 thousand years ago (ka). It has been reported
   that coincident with this extinction the carbon isotopic composition of
   preserved eggshells of the extant emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) shows
   an abrupt dietary shift from tropical grasses (C4 photosynthesis) to
   temperate grasses and/or woody browse (C3 photosynthesis). This abrupt
   shift has been interpreted as signalling ecosystem collapse due to
   landscape burning by humans. We evaluate an alternative interpretation,
   that the shift in diet was not abrupt, but gradual, and caused by the
   weakening of the Australian monsoon.
   Location Lake Eyre, central Australia.
   Methods We re-analysed a large, published dataset of emu diet delta(13)C
   (inferred from delta(13)C of preserved eggshells) spanning the last
   140,000 years, using time-series analysis. Using Akaike's information
   criterion, we compared two contrasting models: (1) there was an abrupt
   shift in delta(13)C coincident with the extinction of Genyornis, assumed
   47.5 ka; and (2) there was a gradual shift in delta(13)C, correlated
   with reconstructed water level in Lake Eyre, a proxy for monsoon
   intensity.
   Results There was little evidence of an abrupt shift in emu diet
   delta(13)C about 45-50 ka, but delta(13)C appeared to steadily decrease
   between about 80 and 30 ka. Indeed, the model representing a correlation
   between delta(13)C and lake level was more than seven times more likely
   than the model representing an abrupt shift at 47.5 ka.
   Main conclusions The emu eggshell isotopic record from Lake Eyre does
   not support the hypothesis that landscape burning by humans transformed
   a savanna-grassland mosaic into the modern desert scrub, contributing to
   the extinction of Genyornis. While our findings cast strong doubt on the
   foremost line of evidence that landscape burning by humans caused the
   megafaunal extinctions, and suggest that central Australia was becoming
   increasingly arid in the Late Pleistocene, the relative roles of hunting
   by humans and climate change in the megafaunal extinctions remain
   unresolved.},

Abstract = {Sea-skaters in the genus Halobates Eschscholtz 1822 include some of the
   most specialised water striders and are found in tropical and
   subtropical seas around the world. Even though species of Halobates
   occur in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Red Sea, no extant sea-skater
   has been reported from the Mediterranean Sea. A fossil, Halobates ruffoi
   Andersen et al., 1994, described from Middle-Upper Eocene (45 Ma) Italy
   indicates that sea skaters were present in this part of the world in the
   past. Other geological evidence points to dramatic changes in the
   Mediterranean Sea during the Tertiary and Quaternary that may have led
   to their later extinction. In this paper we review briefly the
   distribution, systematics, evolution and ecology of Halobates, and
   discuss the potential for the Mediterranean to be recolonised following

Abstract = {The destructiveness of major (Category 3 to 5) hurricanes along the
   United States Atlantic Ocean seaboard has been recognized for centuries.
   While the effects of hurricanes on coastal ecosystems are well known,
   the influence of hurricanes on pelagic seabirds is difficult to assess.
   During the annual Atlantic hurricane season (similar to 1 June to 30
   November), the endangered black-capped petrel Pterodroma hasitata
   aggregates in Gulf Stream habitats from Florida to North Carolina. On at
   least 8 occasions over the past century, hurricanes have driven petrels
   far inland (sometimes as far as the Great Lakes), suggesting the demise
   of 10s to 100s of individuals. This paper models >100 yr of data to
   characterize and compare key aspects of hurricanes that did and did not
   drive petrels inland. Our model suggests that the predicted increase in
   the frequency of Category 3 to 5 hurricanes in the region due to climate
   change could nearly double the expected number of wrecked petrels over
   the next century and place an endangered species at greater risk of
   extinction.},

Abstract = {Plastic responses of species to unprecedented conditions and increased
   variability caused by climate change (CC) and anthropogenic disturbances
   are expected to play a major role determining populations' extinction
   risk. We developed a method for assessing CC effects on population
   dynamics based on analyzing plastic life history responses to weather
   conditions within an ensemble forecasting framework. The method is
   illustrated using two threatened cactus species with contrasting
   distribution ranges. Demographic models were parameterized using 5 years
   of field data, from which the relationship between life-history traits
   and rainfall and temperature was estimated. These functions were used in
   Integral Projection Models to predict population growth under CC
   scenarios and different anthropogenic disturbance regimes. Both species
   were affected by CC and its interaction with disturbance. The most
   widespread species was less affected by CC, suggesting that past
   selection on plasticity allows it to survive under variable conditions.
   Managing disturbance appropriately lessened the impact of CC. Some
   directives for conservation under CC were identified based on projected
   elasticity values. Our procedure for modeling population dynamics as a
   function of climate may be used for designing management plans for
   conservation or sustainable use aimed at important plant sizes or
   life-history traits, predicting potential distributions, and identifying

   concentration of starting materials, on the formation of hollow spheres.
   It was found that the size-tailored TiO2 hollow spheres demonstrate
   tunable light scattering over a wide visible-light range. Inspired by
   the effect of light scattering, we introduced the TiO2 hollow sphere's
   scattering layer in quantum dot-sensitized solar cells and achieved a

Abstract = {Species are influenced by multiple environmental stressors acting
   simultaneously. Our objective was to compare the expected effects of
   climate change and invasion of non-indigenous rainbow smelt (Osmerus
   mordax) on cisco (Coregonus artedii) population extirpations at a
   regional level. We assembled a database of over 13,000 lakes in
   Wisconsin, USA, summarising fish occurrence, lake morphology, water
   chemistry, and climate. We used A1, A2, and B1 scenarios from the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of future temperature
   conditions for 15 general circulation models in 2046-2065 and 2081-2100
   totalling 78 projections. Logistic regression indicated that cisco
   tended to occur in cooler, larger, and deeper lakes. Depending upon the
   amount of warming, 25-70\% of cisco populations are predicted to be
   extirpated by 2100. In addition, cisco are influenced by the invasion of
   rainbow smelt, which prey on young cisco. Projecting current estimates
   of rainbow smelt spread and impact into the future will result in the
   extirpation of about 1\% of cisco populations by 2100 in Wisconsin.
   Overall, the effect of climate change is expected to overshadow that of
   species invasion as a driver of coldwater fish population extirpations.
   Our results highlight the potentially dominant role of climate change as

Abstract = {Predicted effects of climate change include high extinction risk for
   many species, but confidence in these predictions is undermined by a
   perceived lack of empirical support. Many studies have now documented
   ecological responses to recent climate change, providing the opportunity
   to test whether the magnitude and nature of recent responses match
   predictions. Here, we perform a global and multitaxon metaanalysis to
   show that empirical evidence for the realized effects of climate change
   supports predictions of future extinction risk. We use International
   Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List criteria as a common
   scale to estimate extinction risks from a wide range of climate impacts,
   ecological responses, and methods of analysis, and we compare
   predictions with observations. Mean extinction probability across
   studies making predictions of the future effects of climate change was
   7\% by 2100 compared with 15\% based on observed responses. After taking
   account of possible bias in the type of climate change impact analyzed
   and the parts of the world and taxa studied, there was less discrepancy
   between the two approaches: predictions suggested a mean extinction
   probability of 10\% across taxa and regions, whereas empirical evidence
   gave a mean probability of 14\%. As well as mean overall extinction
   probability, observations also supported predictions in terms of
   variability in extinction risk and the relative risk associated with
   broad taxonomic groups and geographic regions. These results suggest
   that predictions are robust to methodological assumptions and provide
   strong empirical support for the assertion that anthropogenic climate
   change is now a major threat to global biodiversity.},

Abstract = {Contemporary climate change is expected to affect the distributions of
   most species, but the nature, tempo, and mechanics of contemporary range
   shifts are still largely speculative. Here, we use fine-scale
   distributional records developed over the past Century, combined with
   spatially comprehensive microclimatic data, to demonstrate a dramatic
   shift in the range of a climate-sensitive mammal and to infer the
   increasingly important role of climate in local extinctions of this
   species across a 38.2 million-ha area. Changes in the distribution of
   the American pika (Ochotona princeps) throughout the Great Basin
   ecoregion were characterized using records from 1898-2008, revealing a
   nearly five-fold increase in the rate of local extinction and an 11-fold
   increase in the rate of upslope range retraction during the last ten
   years, compared with during the 20th Century. Four of ten local pika
   extinctions have occurred since 1999, and across this ecoregion the
   low-elevation range boundary for this species is now moving upslope at
   an average rate of about 145 m per decade. The rapid, ecoregional range
   shift of this small, talus-dwelling species stands in remarkable
   contrast with the dynamics and determinants of endangerment previously
   observed for most terrestrial species, and to earlier extinction
   determinants for O. princeps in this region. Further investigation of
   widely distributed species will clarify rates at which biotic response
   to environmental change is occurring, and how factors driving that
   change are evolving in different portions of the earth.},

Abstract = {This study proposes an ecological mechanism for the terminal Pleistocene
   population collapse and subsequent extinction of North American
   megafauna. Observations of modern ecosystems indicate that feedback
   mechanisms between plant nutrient content, nitrogen cycling, and
   herbivore-plant interactions can vary between a nutrient accelerating
   mode favoring increased herbivore biomass and a nutrient decelerating
   mode characterized by reduced herbivore biomass. These alternate modes
   are determined largely by plant nitrogen content. Plant nitrogen content
   is known to be influenced by atmospheric CO2 concentrations,
   temperature, and precipitation. It is argued that Lateglacial climate
   change, particularly increases in atmospheric CO2, shifted
   herbivore-ecosystem dynamics from a nutrient accelerating mode to a
   nutrient decelerating mode at the end of the Pleistocene, leading to
   reduced megafaunal population densities. An examination of Sporormiella
   records - a proxy for megaherbivore biomass - indicates that megafaunal
   populations collapsed first in the east and later in the west, possibly
   reflecting regional differences in precipitation or vegetation
   structure. The fortuitous intersection of the climatically driven
   nitrogen sink, followed by any one or combination of subsequent
   anthropogenic, environmental, or extra-terrestrial mechanisms could
   explain why extinctions took place at the end of the Pleistocene rather
   than during previous glacial-interglacial cycles. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {We describe two events of water plant extinction in the Hula Valley,
   northern Israel: the ancient, natural extinction of 3 out of 14 extinct
   species at Gesher Benot Ya'aqov, which occurred some 800-700 k.yr., and
   an anthropogenic, near contemporary extinction of seven species in the
   artificial drainage of the Hula Lake in the 1950s. We conclude that the
   considerable fraction of water plants that disappeared from the Hula
   Valley in the Early-Middle Pleistocene was the result of habitat
   desiccation and not global warming. Thus, there is evidence that the
   hominins who lived in the Hula Valley inhabited a comparatively dry
   place. The disappearance of water plant species was partially the result
   of reduced seed dispersal by birds (ornitochory) as a result of the
   shrinkage of water bodies and their number along the Rift Valley. We
   suggest that the disappearance of a group of rare, local water plants
   can be used as an indicator of climate drying and impacts on the local
   vegetation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The Early Toarcian mass extinction event represented the most important
   Mesozoic and Cenozoic turnover of the population of brachiopods and
   severely affected other benthic fauna. Two main hypotheses have been
   proposed to explain the synchronous and global mass extinction: an
   oceanic anoxic event or a warming episode. To test both hypotheses, the
   dynamics of the brachiopod assemblages below and above the extinction
   boundary are analyzed and compared with the seawater paleotemperature
   variations, calculated from the delta O-18 data recorded in belemnite
   rostra. Five sections from Northern and Central Spain, well dated with
   ammonites, have been selected for this study. The sections show no
   indication of sedimentary breaks and contain abundant brachiopods, which
   have been grouped into four assemblages. The changes observed in the
   brachiopod assemblages show a close correlation with the changes in the
   seawater paleotemperatures. The oldest assemblage (assemblage 1)
   coincides with a cooling interval recorded to have taken place in the
   latest Pliensbachian. Paleobiogeographical reconstruction shows that
   this assemblage was distributed at paleolatitudes between 30 and 45
   degrees N, with a preference for relatively cool waters. With the rise
   of temperatures that took place during the earliest Toarcian
   Tenuicostatum Zone, assemblage 1 was substituted by assemblage 2, which
   composed of different species of the same genera but considerably
   restricted to the warmer waters of lower paleolatitudes, between 28 and
   35 degrees N. Coinciding with the rapid and pronounced increase in
   seawater temperature, recorded at the Tenuicostatum-Serpentinum zonal
   boundary, all of these brachiopod species disappeared in the studied
   localities, marking clearly the extinction boundary. Predominant
   southward currents through the Laurasian Seaway precluded the possible
   migration of the brachiopods to cooler northern waters. The brachiopods'
   disappearance is independent from the oxygenation degree of the sea
   bottom, and therefore the rapid warming seems to be the most plausible
   cause of the miss extinction. After the extinction event, the recovery
   of the brachiopods was uneven. Subsequent to a brief pause, recovery was
   rapid in Central Spain and in other southern areas of Western Tethys,
   whereas in northern Spain and in the whole of Europe north of the French
   Central Massif, brachiopods did not recover until the Mid to Late
   Toarcian times. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Permian continental sequences from North China contain previously
   unrecognized episodes of plant radiation and elevated extinction. The
   earliest extinction, in the Lower Shihhotse Formation (Roadian,
   Guadalupian), records a 45\% floral species loss and is tentatively
   correlated with global extinctions amongst dinocephalian reptiles. Two
   younger extinctions are dated by correlating the Illawara Reversal and
   palaeomagnetic polarity sequences from Shanxi Province against global
   palaeomagnetic history. Missing data from the Shanxi sequence are
   evaluated using a novel approach estimating likely maximum and minimum
   sequence changes that provide age estimates for post-Illawara events in
   North China. The second extinction in the middle Upper Shihhotse
   Formation is more significant and is dated to the mid-Capitanian, with a
   loss of 56\% of plant species coinciding with two phases of volcanism of
   the Emeishan Large Igneous Province in South China, previously linked to
   the mid-Capitanian marine mass extinction. The youngest extinction in
   the upper Upper Shihhotse Formation (late Capitanian to
   mid-Wuchapingian) is catastrophic and represents the end of range in the
   sequence. Changes in sedimentary facies suggest it to be related to
   global climatic warming and drying. Other viable causal mechanisms for
   the extinction episodes include plate motion and collision, global
   climate change, volcanism and biological competition.},

Abstract = {Recent climate change has caused the distributions of many species to
   shift poleward, yet few empirical studies have addressed which species
   will be vulnerable to longer-term climate changes. To investigate past
   consequences of climate change, we calculated the population extinction
   rates of 35 reptile species from 87 Greek land-bridge islands in the
   Mediterranean that occurred over the past 16,000 years. Population
   extinction rates were higher for those species that today have more
   northern distributions. We further found that northern species requiring
   cool, mesic habitats had less available suitable habitat among islands,
   implicating loss of suitable habitat in their elevated extinction rates.
   These extinctions occurred in the context of increasing habitat
   fragmentation, with islands shrinking and separating as sea levels rose.
   Thus, the circumstances faced by reptiles on the islands are similar to
   challenges for numerous species today that must cope with a changing
   climate while living in an increasingly human-fragmented landscape. Our
   island-biogeographical approach to investigating historical population
   extinctions gives insight into the long-term patterns of species

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},

Volume = {16},
Number = {12},
Pages = {3215-3222},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Andean plant species are predicted to shift their distributions, or
   `migrate,' upslope in response to future warming. The impacts of these
   shifts on species' population sizes and their abilities to persist in
   the face of climate change will depend on many factors including the
   distribution of individuals within species' ranges, the ability of
   species to migrate and remain at equilibrium with climate, and patterns
   of human land-use. Human land-use may be especially important in the
   Andes where anthropogenic activities above tree line may create a hard
   barrier to upward migrations, imperiling high-elevation Andean
   biodiversity. In order to better understand how climate change may
   impact the Andean biodiversity hotspot, we predict the distributional
   responses of hundreds of plant species to changes in temperature
   incorporating population density distributions, migration rates, and
   patterns of human land-use. We show that plant species from high Andean
   forests may increase their population sizes if able to migrate onto the
   expansive land areas above current tree line. However, if the pace of
   climate change exceeds species' abilities to migrate, all species will
   experience large population losses and consequently may face high risk
   of extinction. Using intermediate migration rates consistent with those
   observed for the region, most species are still predicted to experience
   population declines. Under a business-as-usual land-use scenario, we
   find that all species will experience large population losses regardless
   of migration rate. The effect of human land-use is most pronounced for
   high-elevation species that switch from predicted increases in
   population sizes to predicted decreases. The overriding influence of
   land-use on the predicted responses of Andean species to climate change
   can be viewed as encouraging since there is still time to initiate
   conservation programs that limit disturbances and/or facilitate the
   upward migration and persistence of Andean plant species.},

Abstract = {Phelsuma parkeri Loveridge 1941 is an endemic gecko species native to
   the relatively flat island of Pemba (elevational range 0 to < 100 m
   asl). Information on its distribution on the island and its conservation
   status is currently lacking. Herein, we provide information on the
   spatial distribution of P. parker: and on its adaptability to habitat
   modification and changing climates. Our results imply that until now P.
   parker: has been highly adaptable to anthropogenic habitat modification.
   A comparison with paleoclimatic conditions during the Last Glacial
   Maximum on Pemba has revealed that, in the past, P parkeri and other
   endemic species on the island survived climatic conditions that were
   different from the current climatic conditions despite the absence of
   possibilities for compensating for these changes by means of altitudinal
   range shifts. We predict that P. parkeri is currently unlikely to be
   threatened by climate change. The main potential threat identified may
   be the introduction of invasive species such as Phelsuma dubia (Boettger
   1881), which is already well established on the nearest island, i.e. on
   Zanzibar. Based on our findings, we propose that P. parker: should be
   categorized as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List.},

Title = {Timing of Quaternary megafaunal extinction in South America in relation

Abstract = {South America lost more genera in the Quaternary megafaunal extinction
   than any other continent, but how it fits into the worldwide extinction
   has been unclear largely due to the lack of chronological resolution.
   This work evaluated 138 published radiocarbon dates for megafauna and
   402 published dates for early (>8000 BP) South American archaeological
   sites. A total of 93 megafauna dates for 15 genera, and 110
   archaeological dates on early human appearance, are robust enough to
   assess correspondence between last-appearance records of megafauna,
   first-appearance records of humans, and the Younger Dryas to Holocene
   climatic transition in six different regions of South America.
   Interesting patterns come to light, but are based on few dates,
   particularly in northern South America. No taxon other than Mylodon has
   >7 robust dates, and many taxa have less than 3 dates. Accordingly, an
   assessment of how likely it is that only a few dates will yield the
   youngest date in an underlying frequency distribution of dates was
   conducted, by applying probability and bootstrapping analyses to 27
   dates on Mylodon from southern Patagonia, 26 of them from a single site.
   It was found that 15 dates out of a sample of 27 will commonly yield a
   date within 200 years of the youngest date in the sample. For that
   reason, and because even for a taxon with many dates it is likely that
   the youngest dated specimen pre-dates the actual time of extinction,
   most of the last-appearance dates are interpreted as recording the last
   time taxa were abundant on the landscape, rather than extinction per se.
   With those caveats in mind, on a continental scale most megafauna have
   last appearances after human arrival, but seem to last at least 1000
   years after first human presence. Some taxa apparently survived >6000
   years after humans entered South America and >1000 years after the
   end-Pleistocene climatic changes. Last-appearance patterns for megafauna
   differ from region to region, but in Patagonia, the Argentine and
   Uruguayan Pampas, and Brazil, extinctions seem more common after humans
   arrive and during intensified climatic change between 11.2 and 13.5 ka.
   This pattern suggests that a synergy of human impacts and rapid climate
   change analogous to what is happening today may enhance extinction
   probability. Nevertheless, even in these regions, some megafauna
   persisted for thousands of years after human arrival and after the
   climate warmed. These results highlight the need for future intensive
   dating efforts on South American megafauna and archaeological remains.

   strength. corrected by refractive index. is definitely (ca. 10\%) larger

Abstract = {Low-Temperature Combustion (LTC) is becoming a promising technology for
   simultaneously reducing soot and NOx emissions from diesel engines. LTC
   regimes are evaluated by the flame lift-off length - the distance from
   the injector orifice to the location of hydroxyl luminescence closest to
   the injector in the flame jet. Various works have been dedicated to
   successful simulations of lifted flames of a diesel jet by use of
   various combustion modeling approaches. In this work, flame surface
   density and flamelet concepts were used to model the diesel lift-off
   length under LTC conditions. Numerical studies have been performed with
   the ECFM3Z model, n-Heptane and diesel fuels to determine the flame
   lift-off length and its correlation with soot formation under quiescent
   conditions. The numerical results showed good agreement with
   experimental data, which were obtained from an optically accessible
   constant volume chamber and presented at the Engine Combustion Network
   (ECN) of Sandia National Laboratories. It was shown that at a certain
   distance downstream from the injector orifice, stoichiometric scalar
   dissipation rate matched the extinction scalar dissipation rate. This
   computed extinction scalar dissipation rate correlated well with the
   flame lift-off length. For the range of conditions investigated,
   adequate quantitative agreement was obtained with the experimental
   measurements of lift-off length under various ambient gas O2
   concentrations, ambient gas temperatures, ambient gas densities and fuel
   injection pressures. The results showed that the computed lift-off
   length values for most of the conditions lay in a reasonable range
   within the quasi-steady lift-off length values obtained from
   experiments. However, at ambient temperatures lower than 1000 K, the
   lift-off length values were under-predicted by the numerical analysis.
   This may be due to the use of the droplet evaporation model as it is
   believed that evaporation has a strong effect on the lift-off length.},

Abstract = {Madagascar's rainforests are among the most biodiverse in the world.
   Understanding the population dynamics of important species within these
   forests in response to past climatic variability provides valuable
   insight into current and future species composition. Here, we use a
   population-level approach to analyse palaeo-ecological records over the
   last 5300 years to understand how populations of Symphonia cf. verrucosa
   became locally extinct in some rainforest fragments along the southeast
   coast of Madagascar in response to rapid climate change, yet persisted
   in others. Our results indicate that regional ( climate) variability
   contributed to synchronous decline of S. cf. verrucosa populations in
   these forests. Superimposed on regional fluctuations were local
   processes that could have contributed or mitigated extinction.
   Specifically, in the forest with low soil nutrients, population model
   predictions indicated that there was coexistence between S. cf.
   verrucosa and Erica spp., but in the nutrient-rich forest, interspecific
   effects between Symphonia and Erica spp. may have pushed Symphonia to
   extinction at the peak of climatic change. We also demonstrate that
   Symphonia is a good indicator of a threshold event, exhibiting erratic
   fluctuations prior to and long after the critical climatic point has

   models of the distributions of two extinct British butterflies, Aporia
   crataegi and Polyommatus semiargus, were used to investigate the
   potential for re-establishment in Britain. Generalised additive models
   and generalised linear models were created to describe the species'
   European distributions for the period 1961-1990. All models projected
   the British climate during this period to be suitable for both species.
   Thirty-year climate projections for the periods 1991-2020 and 2021-2050,
   and for three climate change scenarios, were then put into the models to
   generate projections of climatic suitability throughout the 21st
   century. British climate was projected to remain highly suitable for A.
   crataegi, but to decline somewhat for P. semiargus. Southern and eastern
   Britain were found to be the areas most likely to support suitable
   climate. This difference between the species appeared to be due in part
   to decreasing summer rainfall in climate change projections, as this
   should only benefit A. crataegi. It is concluded that, with further
   study of habitat requirements, both species could be reintroduced to
   Britain as part of a long-term European conservation strategy. (C) 2009

Abstract = {Numerous studies over the past 30 years have suggested there is a causal
   connection between the motion of the Sun through the Galaxy and
   terrestrial mass extinctions or climate change. Proposed mechanisms
   include comet impacts (via perturbation of the Oort Cloud), cosmic rays
   and supernovae, the effects of which are modulated by the passage of the
   Sun through the Galactic midplane or spiral arms. Supposed periodicities
   in the fossil record, impact cratering dates or climate proxies over the
   Phanerozoic (past 545 Myr) are frequently cited as evidence in support
   of these hypotheses. This remains a controversial subject, with many
   refutations and replies having been published. Here I review both the
   mechanisms and the evidence for and against the relevance of
   astronomical phenomena to climate change and evolution. This necessarily
   includes a critical assessment of time series analysis techniques and
   hypothesis testing. Some of the Studies have suffered from flaws in
   methodology, in particular drawing incorrect conclusions based on ruling
   out a null hypothesis. I conclude that there is little evidence for
   intrinsic periodicities in biodiversity, impact cratering or climate on
   timescales of tens to hundreds of Myr. Although this does not rule out
   the mechanisms, the numerous assumptions and uncertainties involved in
   the interpretation of the geological data and in particular in the
   astronomical mechanisms suggest that Galactic midplane and spiral arm
   crossings have little impact on biological or climate variation above
   background level. Non-periodic impacts and terrestrial mechanisms
   (volcanism, plate tectonics, sea level changes), possibly occurring
   simultaneously, remain likely causes of many environmental catastrophes.
   Internal dynamics of the biosphere may also play a role. In contrast,
   there is little evidence supporting the idea that cosmic rays have a
   significant influence on climate through cloud formation. It seems
   likely that more than one mechanism has contributed to biodiversity
   variations over the past half Gyr.},

Abstract = {Species responses to climate change may be influenced by changes in
   available habitat, as well as population processes, species interactions
   and interactions between demographic and landscape dynamics. Current
   methods for assessing these responses fail to provide an integrated view
   of these influences because they deal with habitat change or population
   dynamics, but rarely both. In this study, we linked a time series of
   habitat suitability models with spatially explicit stochastic population
   models to explore factors that influence the viability of plant species
   populations under stable and changing climate scenarios in South African
   fynbos, a global biodiversity hot spot. Results indicate that complex
   interactions between life history, disturbance regime and distribution
   pattern mediate species extinction risks under climate change. Our novel
   mechanistic approach allows more complete and direct appraisal of future
   biotic responses than do static bioclimatic habitat modelling
   approaches, and will ultimately support development of more effective
   conservation strategies to mitigate biodiversity losses due to climate
   change.},

Abstract = {The last major global revolution of climate was the transition from the
   last glacial stage to the present interglacial, ca. 25-10 ka.
   Vegetational belts and mammalian communities underwent major
   reorganisation. New radiocarbon data show that the complex series of
   climatic changes affected the ranges of mammalian species dramatically,
   but in differing ways related to the ecologies of individual species.
   For species that ultimately went extinct, the reduction in range was a
   prolonged and geographically complex process taking thousands or tens of
   thousands of years. Recent genetic studies using ancient DNA show that
   this process was often accompanied by loss of genetic variation and,
   presumably, adaptive flexibility. Even so, some species survived for
   thousands of years in small, terminal refugia before finally becoming
   extinct - a pattern akin to the `extinction lag' or `extinction debt'
   posited for endangered modern taxa. Whether refugial. species can
   survive to re-expand into new areas, especially in anthropogenically
   disturbed environments, is determined by a complex of factors and is not
   inevitable. To cite this article: A.M. Lister, A.J. Stuart, C R.

Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {6},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Woolly mammoths inhabited Eurasia and North America from late Middle
   Pleistocene ( 300 ky BP {[} 300,000 years before present]), surviving
   through different climatic cycles until they vanished in the Holocene (
   3.6 ky BP). The debate about why the Late Quaternary extinctions
   occurred has centred upon environmental and human-induced effects, or a
   combination of both. However, testing these two hypotheses-climatic and
   anthropogenic - has been hampered by the difficulty of generating
   quantitative estimates of the relationship between the contraction of
   the mammoth's geographical range and each of the two hypotheses. We
   combined climate envelope models and a population model with explicit
   treatment of woolly mammoth - human interactions to measure the extent
   to which a combination of climate changes and increased human pressures
   might have led to the extinction of the species in Eurasia. Climate
   conditions for woolly mammoths were measured across different time
   periods: 126 ky BP, 42 ky BP, 30 ky BP, 21 ky BP, and 6 ky BP. We show
   that suitable climate conditions for the mammoth reduced drastically
   between the Late Pleistocene and the Holocene, and 90\% of its
   geographical range disappeared between 42 ky BP and 6 ky BP, with the
   remaining suitable areas in the mid-Holocene being mainly restricted to
   Arctic Siberia, which is where the latest records of woolly mammoths in
   continental Asia have been found. Results of the population models also
   show that the collapse of the climatic niche of the mammoth caused a
   significant drop in their population size, making woolly mammoths more
   vulnerable to the increasing hunting pressure from human populations.
   The coincidence of the disappearance of climatically suitable areas for
   woolly mammoths and the increase in anthropogenic impacts in the
   Holocene, the coup de grace, likely set the place and time for the
   extinction of the woolly mammoth.},

Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Pages = {140-150},

Abstract = {Limitations imposed on species ranges by the climatic, ecological, and
   physiological effects of elevation are important determinants of
   extinction risk. We modeled the effects of elevational limits on the
   extinction risk of landbirds, 87\% of all bird species. Elevational
   limitation of range size explained 97\% of the variation in the
   probability of being in a World Conservation Union category of
   extinction risk. Our model that combined elevational ranges, four
   Millennium Assessment habitat-loss scenarios, and an intermediate
   estimate of surface warming of 2.8 degrees C, projected a best guess of
   400-550 landbird extinctions, and that approximately 2150 additional
   species would be at risk of extinction by 2100. For Western Hemisphere
   landbirds, intermediate extinction estimates based on climate-induced
   changes in actual distributions ranged from 1.3\% (1.1 degrees C
   warming) to 30.0\% (6.4 degrees C warming) of these species. Worldwide,
   every degree of warming projected a nonlinear increase in bird
   extinctions of about 100-500 species. Only 21\% of the species predicted
   to become extinct in our scenarios are currently considered threatened
   with extinction. Different habitat-loss and surface-warming scenarios
   predicted substantially different futures for landbird species. To
   improve the precision of climate-induced extinction estimates, there is
   an urgent need for high-resolution measurements of shifts in the
   elevational ranges of species. Given the accelerating influence of
   climate change on species distributions and conservation, using
   elevational limits in a tested, standardized, and robust manner can
   improve conservation assessments of terrestrial species and will help
   identify species that are most vulnerable to global climate change. Our
   climate-induced extinction estimates are broadly similar to those of
   bird species at risk from other factors, but these estimates largely
   involve different sets of species.},

   and genera) is related to temperature and has been relatively low during
   warm `greenhouse' phases, while during the same phases extinction and
   origination rates of taxonomic lineages have been relatively high. These
   findings are consistent for terrestrial and marine environments and are
   robust to a number of alternative assumptions and potential biases. Our
   results provide the first clear evidence that global climate may explain
   substantial variation in the fossil record in a simple and consistent

   regard to the need for adequate pre-adaptations, namely technologies for

   pre-existing biological cold adaptations delayed the development of such

   their extinction. In contrast, the greater biological vulnerability of

Abstract = {Abalone abundance surveys from the 1970s were repeated 30 yrs later
   following a period of increased sea surface temperatures along the
   Pacific coast of the United States. Northern abalone, Haliotis
   kamtschatkana (Jonas, 1845) once abundant enough to support commercial
   fishing in Washington and Canada, are now extremely rare in the southern
   portion of their range in southern and central California. They have
   also declined 10 fold in northern California in the absence of human
   fishing pressure. In Washington, northern abalone are in decline and
   exhibit recruitment failure despite closure of the fishery. Flat
   abalone, Haliotis walallensis (Stearns, 1899) no longer occur in
   southern California, and in central California have declined from 32\%
   to 8\% of the total number of abalones, Haliotis spp., inside a marine
   reserve. The distribution of flat abalone appears to have contracted
   over time such that they are now only common in southern Oregon where
   they are subject to a new commercial fishery. Given these range
   reductions, the long-term persistence of flat abalone and northern
   abalone (locally) is a concern in light of threats from ocean warming,
   sea otter predation, and the flat abalone fishery in Oregon. The
   likelihood of future ocean warming poses challenges for abalone
   restoration, suggesting that improved monitoring and protection will be
   critical, especially in the northern portions of their distributions.},

Title = {Isotopic signatures of extinct low-temperature hydrothermal chimneys in
   the Jaroso Mars analog},

Year = {2007},
Volume = {55},
Number = {4},
Pages = {441-448},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The present work presents a geochemical study, focused on the oxygen and
   carbon isotopic signatures of shallow-marine, carbonate extinct
   chimneys, from Jaroso Hydrothermal System (JHS). In each chimney a
   meticulous sampling from the central orifice to the outer rim of the
   structure was performed. The isotopic geochemistry study allowed to
   establish the origin and evolution of the fluids during the formation of
   the vent structures. The negative delta C-13 values indicate a source of
   meteoric water for the Fe-rich fluids. More positive delta C-13 values
   are present in ankerite and in some calcite, both related with marine
   water. delta O-18 in ankerite indicates low-temperature hydrothermal
   conditions, while in calcite is showing either primary signatures or
   early diagenesis at low temperature. On the contrary, calcite displaying
   more negative delta C-13 and delta O-18 values represents a late mineral
   phase which was formed under meteoric diagenesis. Each chimney resulted
   from the precipitation of intergranular carbonate cement around a
   channellized flux of metal-rich fluid crossing a shallow-marine,
   unconsolidated, sandy-mart substrate. The paleoenvironmental
   interpretation carried out from the isotopic data emphasizes the
   importance of the stable isotopes as fluid geomarkers, also advancing in
   the understanding of an interesting analog for the geological and
   astrobiological exploration of Mars. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Widespread extinction is a predicted ecological consequence of global
   warming. Extinction risk under climate change scenarios is a function of
   distribution breadth. Focusing on trees and birds of the eastern United
   States, we used joint climate and environment models to examine fit and
   climate change vulnerability as a function of distribution breadth. We
   found that extinction vulnerability increases with decreasing
   distribution size. We also found that model fit decreases with
   decreasing distribution size, resulting in high prediction uncertainty
   among narrowly distributed species. High prediction uncertainty creates
   a conservation dilemma in that excluding these species under-predicts
   extinction risk and favors mistaken inaction on global warming. By
   contrast, including narrow endemics results in over-predicting
   extinction risk and promotes mistaken inaction on behalf of individual
   species prematurely considered doomed to extinction.},

Abstract = {The threat of global warming to rare species is a growing concern, yet
   few studies have predicted its effects on rare populations. Using
   demographic data gathered in both drought and nondrought years between
   1996-2003 in central Arizona upper Sonoran Desert, we modeled population
   viability for the federally endangered Purshia subintegra (Kearney)
   Henrickson (Arizona cliffrose). We used deterministic matrix projection
   models and stochastic models simulating weather conditions during our
   study, given historical weather variation and under scenarios of
   increased aridity. Our models suggest that the P subintegra population
   in Verde Valley is slowly declining and will be at greater risk of
   extinction with increased aridity. Across patches at a fine spatial
   scale, demographic performance was associated with environmental
   factors. Moist sites (patches with the highest soil moisture, lowest
   sand content, and most northern aspects) had the highest densities,
   highest seedling recruitment, and highest risk of extinction over the
   shortest time span. Extinction risk in moist sites was exacerbated by
   higher variance in recruitment and mortality. Dry sites had higher
   cumulative adult survival and lower extinction risk but negative growth
   rates. Steps necessary for the conservation of the species include
   introductions at more northern latitudes and in situ manipulations to
   enhance seedling recruitment and plant survival. We demonstrate that
   fine spatial-scale modeling is necessary to predict where patches with
   highest extinction risk or potential refugia for rare species may occur.
   Because current climate projections for the 21st century imply range
   shifts at rates of 300 to 500 km/century, which are beyond even
   exceptional examples of shifts in the fossil record of 100-150 km, it is
   likely that preservation of many rare species will require human
   intervention and a long-term commitment. Global warming conditions are
   likely to reduce the carrying capacity of many rare species' habitats.},

   these temperature and extinction maps ( covering tens of square degrees

   Coordinated Molecular Probe Line Extinction Thermal Emission ( COMPLETE)

   from the IRIS emission maps are globally accurate, we warn that
   far-infrared emission is not a good proxy for extinction on the scale of
   1 pixel (similar to 5'). In addition to describing the global dust
   properties of these clouds, we have found two particularly interesting
   features in the column density and temperature maps. In the Ophiuchus
   dark cloud complex, the new dust temperature map shows a little-known
   warm ( 25 K) dust ring with a 2 pc diameter. This shell is approximately

Abstract = {Aim Concern over the implications of climate change for biodiversity has
   led to the use of species-climate `envelope' models to forecast risks of
   species extinctions under climate change scenarios. Recent studies have
   demonstrated significant variability in model projections and there
   remains a need to test the accuracy of models and to reduce
   uncertainties. Testing of models has been limited by a lack of data
   against which projections of future ranges can be tested. Here we
   provide a first test of the predictive accuracy of such models using
   observed species' range shifts and climate change in two periods of the
   recent past.
   Location Britain.
   Methods Observed range shifts for 116 breeding bird species in Britain
   between 1967 and 1972 (t(1)) and 1987-91 (t(2)) are used. We project
   range shifts between t(1) and t(2) for each species based on observed
   climate using 16 alternative models (4 methods x 2 data
   parameterizations x 2 rules to transform probabilities of occurrence
   into presence and absence records).
   Results Modelling results were extremely variable, with projected range
   shifts varying both in magnitude and in direction from observed changes
   and from each other. However, using approaches that explore the central
   tendency (consensus) of model projections, we were able to improve
   agreement between projected and observed shifts significantly.
   Conclusions Our results provide the first empirical evidence of the
   value of species-climate `envelope' models under climate change and
   demonstrate reduction in uncertainty and improvement in accuracy through
   selection of the most consensual projections.},

Abstract = {In the past decade, a growing number of studies have modeled the effects

   example, them multispecies modeling effort that has been conducted for
   the proteas of the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, to illustrate
   lessons learned in this and other multispecies modeling efforts.
   Modeling shows that a substantial number of species may lose all
   suitable range and many may lose all representation in protected areas
   as a result of climate change, while a much larger number may experience
   major loss in the amount of their range that is protected. The spatial
   distribution of protected areas, particularly between lowlands and

Abstract = {Implementation of the pure-rotational Raman (PRR) lidar method for
   simultaneous measurement of atmospheric temperature, humidity, and
   aerosol extinction and backscatter coefficients is reported. The
   isolation of two wavelength domains of the PRR spectrum and the
   suppression of the elastically scattered light is carried out by a
   double-grating polychromator. Experiments involving elastic backscatter
   from dense clouds and a solid target confirm the high level of
   suppression of the elastic light in the corresponding acquisition
   channels of the two selected PRR domains. Calibration of the temperature
   channel was done both by comparison with an experimentally verified
   atmospheric temperature model profile and by inter-comparison with
   radiosondes. Night-time temperature profiles with high vertical
   resolution were obtained up to the lower stratosphere. The PRR
   temperature profile combined with the water vapor mixing ratio obtained
   from the ro-vibrational Raman channel is used to estimate the relative
   humidity.},

Title = {Ecological niches as stable distributional constraints on mammal
   species, with implications for Pleistocene extinctions and climate
   change projections for biodiversity},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Pages = {305-314},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Aim Theoretical work suggests that species' ecological niches should
   remain relatively constant over long-term ecological time periods, but
   empirical tests are few. We present longitudinal studies of 23 extant
   mammal species, modelling ecological niches and predicting geographical
   distributions reciprocally between the Last Glacial Maximum and present
   to test this evolutionary conservatism.
   Location This study covered distributional shifts in mammal species
   across the lower 48 states of the United States.
   Methods We used a machine-learning tool for modelling species'
   ecological niches, based on known occurrences and electronic maps
   summarizing ecological dimensions, to assess the ability of ecological
   niches as modelled in one time period to predict the geographical
   distribution of the species in another period, and vice versa.
   Results High intertemporal predictivity between niche models and
   species' occurrences indicate that niche conservatism is widespread
   among the taxa studied, particularly when statistical power is
   considered as a reason for failure of reciprocal predictions. Niche
   projections to the present for 8 mammal taxa that became extinct at the
   end of the Pleistocene generally increased in area, and thus do not
   support the hypothesis of niche collapse as a major driving force in
   their extinction.
   Main conclusions Ecological niches represent long-term stable
   constraints on the distributional potential of species; indeed, this
   study suggests that mammal species have tracked consistent climate
   profiles throughout the drastic climate change events that marked the
   end of the Pleistocene glaciations. Many current modelling efforts
   focusing on anticipating climate change effects on species' potential
   geographical distributions will be bolstered by this result - in
   essence, the first longitudinal demonstration of niche conservatism.},

Abstract = {Climate change over the past similar to30 years has produced numerous
   shifts in the distributions and abundances of species(1,2) and has been
   implicated in one species-level extinction(3). Using projections of
   species' distributions for future climate scenarios, we assess
   extinction risks for sample regions that cover some 20\% of the Earth's
   terrestrial surface. Exploring three approaches in which the estimated
   probability of extinction shows a powerlaw relationship with
   geographical range size, we predict, on the basis of mid-range
   climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15 - 37\% of species in our
   sample of regions and taxa will be `committed to extinction'. When the
   average of the three methods and two dispersal scenarios is taken,
   minimal climate-warming scenarios produce lower projections of species
   committed to extinction (similar to18\%) than mid-range (similar to24\%)
   and maximum-change (similar to35\%) scenarios. These estimates show the
   importance of rapid implementation of technologies to decrease
   greenhouse gas emissions and strategies for carbon sequestration.},

Abstract = {The post-mortem temporal and thermal limits within which there will be
   ample guarantees of rescuing living skin cells from dead specimens of
   two species, rabbit and pig, were studied. Postmortem extirpated whole
   ears were stored (in non-aseptic conditions) either at 4 degreesC or at
   room temperature (from 22 to 25 degreesC) or at 35 degreesC for
   different time lapses after animal death. In both species, the
   post-mortem maximum time lapses where cell viability was not
   significantly reduced were 240,72, and 24 h post-mortem (hpm) for 4,
   22-25 and 35 degreesC, respectively. Once the post-mortem temporal
   limits for each tested thermal level at which cells from skin samples
   are able to grow in culture were defined, the survival ability of skin
   samples submitted to these temporal limits and cryopreserved were
   tested. In the pig, skin samples stored at the three tested thermal
   levels survived after vitrification-warming, reaching confluence in
   culture. In rabbit, only tissue samples from ears stored at 35 degreesC
   for 24 hpm did not survive after vitrification-warming. In conclusion,
   we should remark that cell survival rates obtained according to the
   assayed post-mortem time lapses and thermal levels are sufficient to
   collect and to cryopreserve skin samples from the majority of dead

Abstract = {The lidar of the Radio Science Center for Space and Atmosphere (RASC;
   Kyoto, Japan) makes use of two pure rotational Raman (RR) signals for
   both the measurement of the atmospheric temperature profile and the
   derivation of a temperature-independent Raman reference signal. The
   latter technique is new and leads to significantly smaller measurement
   uncertainties compared with the commonly used vibrational Raman lidar
   technique., For the measurement of temperature, particle extinction
   coefficient, particle backscatter coefficient, and humidity
   simultaneously, only four lidar signals are needed: the elastic Cabannes
   backscatter signal, two RR signals, and the vibrational Raman water
   vapor signal. The RASC lidar provides RR signals of unprecedented
   intensity. Although only 25\% of the RR signal intensities can be used
   with the present data-acquisition electronics, the 1-s statistical
   uncertainty of nighttime temperature measurements is lower than for
   previous systems and is <1K up to 11-km height for, e.g., a resolution
   of 500 m and 9 rain. In addition, RR measurements in daytime also have
   become feasible. (C) 2002 Optical Society of America.},

   constant, the dissipated energy and the I(2)t value decrease with the
   granulometry, whereas the maximum value of the are voltage increases
   with the granulometry. The rate of decrease of the temperature depends
   on the time interval observed: at the beginning of the arcing period,
   the decrease is fastest for the smallest granulometric parameters; and
   during the last part of the arcing period the trend is reversed. At the
   beginning of the arcing period, the electron number density increase

   lambda 6584, {[}S II] lambda lambda (6717 + 6731), and {[}S III] lambda
   9061, as well as in various continuum filters. As a result, we are able
   to evaluate the excitation structure of the source and determine the
   projected variations in density, extinction, and temperature. Density is
   found to have a bilobal structure at the nucleus, where peak values
   approach 2 x 10(3) cm(-3), and thereafter decline to similar to 500
   cm(-3) for distances similar to +/- 12 `` from the central star.
   Densities for larger spatial offsets appear more uniform, although the
   maps reveal evidence for appreciable small-scale dumping. Electron
   temperatures appear to vary by no more than DeltaT(e)/T-e similar to
   0.035 throughout much of the shell, although here again T-e rises by
   similar to 14\% a little to the southeast of the nucleus, an enhancement
   which may also extend northwest and southeast along P.A. = 135 degrees.
   Finally, it is noted that, as in the case of extinction and density, the
   extinction is prone to small but quite rapid variations over the
   projected surface of the source by of order DeltaA(v) similar to +/- 0.1
   mag. There appears to be evidence for a band of extinction with
   amplitude DeltaA(v) similar to 0.2 mag along the minor axis of the
   exterior bilobal flow and for a possible extinction deficit associated
   with the interior bilobal flow. We discuss possible scenarios for the

Abstract = {For a species whose abundance is well-known to correlate on the degree
   of heat different temperature model assumptions may affect the prognosis
   accuracy of persistence. Likewise, year-to-year autocorrelations in
   weather fluctuations are known to decrease extinction risk. Thus, we
   investigated the grey bush cricket Platycleis albopunctata. For this
   species is known that growth and reproduction is mainly influenced by
   temperature. We developed a stochastic individual based model for the
   bush cricket. This day-degree model described the demographic growth of
   the species that depends on temperature. Daily temperatures were
   generated by five different methods: (i) temperatures were sequentially
   taken from a meteorological database. To analyse the influence of
   different levels of autocorrelation in temperature records (ii) the
   day-to-day correlations were reduced by randomly permuting the sequence
   of days within the months of successive years from the database, (iii)
   year-to-year correlations were reduced by randomly rearranging the
   sequence of the years held in the database, (iv) combined day-to-day and
   year-to-year correlations were reduced according to the submodel (ii)
   and (iii), and finally (v) temperatures were randomly generated on the
   basis of Gaussian normal distributions. The mean and the variance of
   these distributions depended on the date of the year. Distributions were
   derived from the above mentioned meteorological database. We estimated
   highly different minimum viable population sizes. These did severely
   depend on the chosen temperature model. Values ranged from 3000 adults
   to more than a million adults per generation. High amounts of
   autocorrelation in temperature values decreased the extinction risk of a
   bush cricket population. Permuting the sequence of the years in the
   database increased extinction risk less than reducing day-to-day
   correlations. A decrease in autocorrelation of temperature records can
   result in unrealistic phenologies of life stages. Decreasing day-to-day
   or year-to-year autocorrelation in temperature records resulted in an
   increase or a decrease of the duration of the egg development or the
   duration of larval development. For poikilothermic species general
   implications are presented that are relevant for the design of
   quantitative models used in conservation biology. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Pages = {227-242},
Abstract = {The effect of steam addition on the structure and extinction of
   hydrogen/air premixed flames is investigated numerically with a detailed
   kinetic mechanism by adopting both counterflow and stagnation-point flow
   configurations as model problems. For a specified equivalence ratio of
   hydrogen/air mixture, the flames in a stagnation-point flow can be
   maintained to higher steam content compared to those in a counterffow.
   This can be explained based on the local strain rates defined at the
   location of maximum heat release rate. The effects of preferential
   diffusion and reaction incompleteness caused by flame stretch and the
   effect of steam addition on flame extinction can be successfully
   quantified by adopting a local equilibrium temperature, which can be
   determined from chemical equilibrium calculation using the temperature
   and concentrations of a local mixture in a flow field. The structure of
   near-stoichiometric flames with the variation in steam content can be
   successfully explained by introducing a local equivalence ratio.},

Abstract = {This paper is the second step in the study of deviations from
   equilibrium in models of decaying SF6 arcs. The first step was based on
   a kinetic approach, which allowed us to study the influence of
   deviations from chemical equilibrium. Departures from equilibrium are
   shown for a simplified geometry, and we find results similar to those of
   in the literature for the influence of pressure or intensity. In order
   to build the basis of the two-temperature model, we calculated the
   two-temperature composition, the transport coefficients and
   thermodynamic properties, and the energy exchange term between electrons
   and heavy particles through elastic collisions.
   lectron-ion collisions contribute to the main part of the energy
   exchange term, S+ and S-2(+) having the greatest contributions to this
   term. Our results show that taking departures from thermal equilibrium
   into account leads to a slower cooling rate of the plasma. The evolution
   of temperature departures during extinction is in agreement with
   experimental results.},

Abstract = {The generation/extinction phenomenon of a crystal nucleus was studied
   for 4-dibenzylamino-2-methylbenzaldehyde-1, 1-diphenylhydrazone by using
   a differential scanning calorimeter at 120-450 K. Class transition and
   fusing temperatures were found to be T-g = 306.6 K and T-fus = 422.2 K,
   respectively, at the heating rate of 2 K min(-1). Bulk crystallization,
   observed in the range 390-400 K, was used to check whether the crystal
   nucleation did or did not proceed at low temperatures. The effective
   nucleus which had a radius larger than the critical value at 290 K was
   generated through annealing the sample for 1 h in the range 120-280 K or
   for 5 min at 170-270 K. The crystal nucleation process was thus found to
   proceed even at 120 K, lower by 186 K than the T-g. This is interpreted
   as indicating that the nucleation rate is controlled by the
   characteristic time of the beta-molecular rearrangement process which
   could be much shorter than the annealing period. The crystal nucleus
   generated during the annealing at 220 K for 1 h was found to be
   extinguished by rapid heating to temperatures above 300 K. This is
   qualitatively understood from a classical theory.},

Abstract = {Temperature is one of the most important parameters to be measured in
   industrial process control. The primary reason for interest in
   industrial fiber optic temperature sensors is their electromagnetic
   immunity and electrical passivity. This enables the use of fiber optic
   sensors in electromagnetically hostile and hazardous environments.
   During the last decade, many intrinsic optical fiber temperature sensors
   have been proposed using the Michelson or Mach-Zehnder configuration.
   However, those interferometers suffer low selectivity and require a well
   isolated and undisturbed reference arm that is very hard to produce. An
   alternative to the classic interferometry is a polarimetric sensor which
   uses the interference of two polarization eigenmodes in high
   birefringence fibers.
   We theoretically and experimentally investigated the influences of the
   sensing and lead fiber length, the extinction ratio of the input
   polarizer and the coherence properties of the light source for
   polarimetric temperature measurements. We have shown that there is a
   possibility to construct a relatively simple and inexpensive fiber optic
   polarimetric thermometer for absolute temperature measurements by using
   a low ER polarizer and a low coherent source,
   The proposed polarimeter does not exhibit high sensitivity However, it
   is easy to achieve a large unambiguous range with a resolution below 0.1
   degrees C, which satisfies most demands in many industrial and medical

Abstract = {Techniques used to remove atmospheric extinction cannot be used for
   interstellar extinction, because objects can be observed at only a
   single extinction, which varies from object to object. The interstellar
   extinction is thus unknowable without the use of prior information about
   the object. In this paper we show how to apply such knowledge in the
   case of normal stars. Using standard passbands, an accepted average
   optical interstellar extinction law, and Kurucz flux tables, we derive
   useful colour-dependent interstellar extinction relations for synthetic
   versions of two widely used sets of broad band photometric passbands,
   Johnson-Cousins UBVRI and Washington CMT(1)T(2). For the Washington
   system, we define a new internal reddening system. For bands blueward of
   500 nm in either photometric system the reddenings for main sequence
   stars and evolved stars are quite different, and even can be non-linear
   as a function of temperature colour. These corrections are important for
   the correct characterisation of the intrinsic reddening properties of
   interstellar dust, for fitting isochrones accurately, for determining
   stellar metallicities, for obtaining correct standard reddenings for
   reddened galactic clusters, and indeed for the determination of basic
   stellar parameters for single stars such as T-eff and M(bol). To make
   the reddenings to different objects comparable, we standardise the
   reddening on that of a solar metallicity main sequence star of T-eff =
   17 000 K (B3-4 V). The functional dependence of the extinction curves on
   abundance is not as important in the Johnson-Cousins as in the
   Washington system. We compute new theoretical reddening vectors in both
   systems, and evaluate the size of the nonlinearity with extinction
   (Forbes effect).},

Abstract = {In synthetic versions of two broadband photometric systems,
   Johnson-Cousins and Washington, we find the dependence of atmospheric
   extinction corrections on colour and on macro features in the spectra of
   stars, such as the Balmer jump, as parameterised by T-eff, log g, and
   {[}Fe/H]. We use standard passbands, a mean atmospheric extinction law
   measured at ESO/La Silla, extended and modified by us, and the Kurucz
   library of synthetic spectra. The true broadband atmospheric extinction
   is far more complicated than any current reduction (transformation)
   methods consider. Hence all broadband magnitude systems are
   fundamentally unphysical - they contain not the extra-atmospheric
   magnitudes, but unobservable magnitudes whose relation to physical
   magnitudes is unknown, but may differ by 0.05 mag or more for hot and
   cool stars. Hence, it is hazardous to compare them to any synthetic
   magnitude system derived from either synthetic spectra or spectral
   scans. These problems exist to a lesser degree in intermediate band
   systems, but narrow band systems are relatively immune from these
   complexities. We do not treat either kind of system here. If our results
   were incorporated into a photometric reduction program, and standard
   stars and program stars stars carefully selected by metallicity and
   luminosity class, a standard magnitude system could be established that
   would be directly comparable to synthetic systems. As a bonus,
   measurements of intrinsic flux variations at the millimagnitude level
   would become more secure. We describe our own operational photometric
   transformation program that incorporates only the linear part of the
   dependence on colour of atmospheric extinction. Our results and
   prescriptions are useful for aperture photoelectric photometry, but our
   implementation is aimed at CCD photometry of stellar populations.},

Abstract = {About half the Caribbean hermatypic corals died out in the Caribbean
   during the latest Oligocene through Early Miocene, about 24-16 Ma. The
   majority of those corals that died out in the Caribbean are extant in
   the Indo-Pacific, i.e., they suffered geographic restriction, rather
   than extinction. The coral and coral associate faunas of three Upper
   Oligocene and three Middle Miocene fossil reefs in western Puerto Rico
   were compared. Coral genera at these sites suffered 50\% regional
   extinction (extinction or restriction), equivalent to earlier reports of
   this Caribbean coral extinction/restriction event. Nearly all coral
   genera tolerant of both turbidity and cool water survived; those
   tolerant of cool water or turbidity alone survived in much lesser
   proportions. Corals occurring on both patch reefs and shelf edge reefs
   survived in much greater proportions than those occurring on only patch
   reefs or only shelf edge reefs. There are no shelf edge barrier reef
   complexes documented from the Early or Middle Miocene in the Caribbean;
   the uppermost Miocene shelf edge reefs of Mona Island are the only known
   shelf edge reefs deposits in the Caribbean.
   Coral associates, the endolithic sponges, bivalves, worms, and barnacles
   that live in coral skeletons, were almost completely unaffected by this
   event. Likewise, reef and off-reef gastropods, bivalves, and echinoids
   suffered only insignificant reductions in diversity. Only corals and
   large benthic foraminifera were strongly affected by the extinction. It
   is significant that zooxanthellate organisms were the primary victims of
   this extinction.
   Miocene endolithic sponge borings are significantly larger than their
   Oligocene counterparts, suggesting more intense bioerosion on Miocene
   than Oligocene reefs. Bioerosion is generally correlated with nutrient
   levels, and the apparently more intense bioerosion of Miocene corals may
   indicate enhanced nutrient availability on Miocene Caribbean reefs.
   Extensive Miocene phosphorites throughout the Caribbean indicate
   enhanced upwelling in the region during the time of the coral
   extinction/restriction. Biogeographic evidence from corals, coral
   associates, and molluscs corroborates this pattern, along with the
   evidence from bioerosion levels. Enhanced upwelling could account for
   the extinction/restriction by generally increasing nutrient levels and
   cooling Caribbean costal surface waters, thus restricting reef
   development to on-shelf patch reefs, where corals would be subject to
   more intense sedimentation. Modern reefs of the Eastern Pacific may
   provide a modern analogue to Miocene Caribbean reefs.
   This regional extinction was important in dividing a previously
   comsmopolitan reef fauna into several modern provincial faunas. This
   biogeographic separation was completed in the mid-Pliocene with the rise
   of the isthmus of Panama. Coral associates, which universally survived
   the Oligocene-Miocene event, also have much more cosmopolitan
   distributions than do corals.},

Abstract = {Climatic change has long been regarded as an important factor in
   evolutionary history. In particular, periods of enhanced extinction in
   marine tara (especially those from warmer waters) have frequently been
   linked to decreases in seawater temperature. Studies of the physiology
   of marine invertebrates and fish alive today have revealed
   well-developed abilities to cope with temperature change, and there
   would thus appear to be a dichotomy between the rates of temperature
   change associated with extinction in geological history and the very
   much faster rates (by several orders of magnitude) with which many
   marine organisms can cope today. Nevertheless, evidence from ecology and
   biogeography indicates that temperature, or some temperature-associated
   factor, does play a significant role in determining the limits to
   performance, and hence distribution. The resolution of the dichotomy
   between the evidence from paleontology and physiology may come through a
   consideration of the role of the previous evolutionary history of the
   fauna, the influence of sudden temperature events, or the impact of
   climatic change on individual competitive ability, community structure,
   and ecosystem functioning. Studies of the energetics of marine
   invertebrates in relation to temperature and the evolutionary history of
   polar faunas indicate that we should beware of anthropocentric
   judgements in attempting to understand the role of climatic change in
   evolutionary history, and be critical in distinguishing the role of
   temperature per se from temperature-associated ecological factors.
   present evidence suggests that climatic change in the sea, at least at
   the rates currently believed to be typical, is unlikely to cause
   extinction by direct physiological impact. It is more likely that
   extinction is caused by ecological factors; temperature change is thus
   only one of several factors that may promote those ecological changes
   that are currently the best candidates for the proximate cause of
   extinction in the sea.},

Abstract = {A turbulent counterflow diffusion flame of natural gas stabilized
   between two opposed jets discharging from straight tubes of 25.4 mm
   diameter fitted with turbulence-promoting perforated plates has been
   examined in terms of its appearance, extinction limits, and mean and
   fluctuating temperatures as measured by numerically compensated
   fine-wire thermocouples. It was observed that the flame was flat, blue,
   and located around the symmetry plane, that its appearance did not
   change with initial premixing of the fuel stream with air, and that a
   premixed flame could also be stabilized provided the equivalence ratio
   was smaller than that of the rich flammability limit. The bulk velocity
   for extinction of the nonpremixed flame increased with tube separation
   and with initial premixing, but decreased with an increase in turbulent
   intensity. The extinction data collapsed to a single curve to within
   20\% if the total strain rate acting on the flame (bulk plus small-scale
   turbulent) was plotted as a function of the air volume fraction in the
   fuel stream, implying a critical total strain rate for extinction that
   depended only on the degree of partial premixing. Partial premixing
   increased the resistance of the flame to straining, from about 350 s-1
   for pure fuel to about 600 s-1 for an air volume fraction of 0.8,
   consistent with experiments and predictions for laminar counterflow
   flames and with experimental data from piloted turbulent jet flames. The
   present results for the total strain rate at extinction provide a
   quantitative description of the effect of partial premixing on flame
   stability and can be used to predict the extinction of nonpremixed
   flames in other geometries. The maximum mean temperature of the flame
   did not change as extinction was approached and was about 1300 +/- 50 K
   for all flow conditions measured, while the rms fluctuations were about
   450 K; this insensitivity is attributed to a low-frequency (as indicated
   by high-pass filtering the temperature time series) flame motion, which
   also resulted in broad temperature probability density functions.},

Abstract = {Turritelline gastropods (Mesogastropoda, Turritellidae) are common to
   abundant components in many fossil (Cretaceous, Cenozoic) and Recent
   marine benthic communities, but the environmental factors affecting
   their evolution and extinction are poorly understood. This is in large
   part because today they occur most abundantly in cooler waters
   associated with upwelling or other high-nutrient conditions, but thermal
   tolerances and preferences are unclear for extinct turritelline species.
   Turritellines were diverse and abundant throughout the New World for
   much of the Cenozoic. Beginning in the early Neogene, through both
   extinction and range contraction, however, they started to disappear
   from higher latitudes on both Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North and
   Central America. The highest rate of extinction took place in the
   western Atlantic in the Plio-Pleistocene, when almost all turritelline
   species in this area became extinct. Preliminary comparison of the
   available stratigraphic record suggests that this paleobiogeographic
   pattern is not an artefact of the record. This biogeographic shift
   coincides with a postulated regional mass extinction among all marine
   mollusks in the western Atlantic at around the same time. Causes for
   turritelline extinction, however, appear to be more complex than the
   decline in temperature that is cited most often as the probable cause of
   the western Atlantic molluskan extinction event. Neogene turritellines
   in the western Atlantic appear to have been adversely affected by
   collapse and/or major reorganization of oceanic productivity associated
   with the formation of the Isthmus of Panama. Nutrients thus may have
   been more important than temperature change in controlling extinction
   probability in this group.},

Volume = {86},

Abstract = {Structures, extinction and ignition limits of strained diffusion flames
   are examined. The influence of the oxidizer stream temperature is
   specifically considered. Calculations are performed for diffusion flames
   formed by a counterflow of diluted hydrogen and air. The air temperature
   differs from the hydrogen temperature. The reactive flow equations are
   solved numerically by employing Newton iterations and adaptive
   continuation techniques. The model includes detailed transport and
   complex kinetics. Flame structures, extinction and ignition limits and
   characteristic flame response curves are determined for different values
   of the fuel-air ratio and for a set of air stream temperatures. It is
   shown that this last parameter strongly affects the conditions producing
   extinction. For an air stream temperature of 1000 K, the critical
   extinction strain rate is ten times that found for an air stream at room
   temperature. It is also found that a temperature exists beyond which
   combustion always takes place whatever the strain rate. These
   observations have important implications in turbulent combustion
   modeling and in the analysis of supersonic combustion.},

Abstract = {Assumptions that correlations of climate and natural vegetation are also
   causal underlie the use of general circulation models (GCMs) for
   predicting vegetation change at a national or global scale. Yet direct
   links between macroclimate and plant distribution are difficult to
   demonstrate. Studies of vegetation change in the pre-Pleistocene past
   and invasions of pine trees in the present indicate that the effects of
   climate are seldom direct. Vegetation change is most often caused by
   changes in disturbance regime or in competitive interactions, especially
   at the seedling stage. We argue that population-level studies, using
   predictions of climate effects on productivity of different growth forms
   and the (limited) knowledge of climate effects on reproductive biology,
   offer an important alternative to predicting and coping with climate
   change.},
