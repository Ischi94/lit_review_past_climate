abstract={Climate change is a well-documented driver of both wildlife extinction and disease emergence, but the negative impacts of climate change on parasite diversity are undocumented. We compiled the most comprehensive spatially explicit data set available for parasites, projected range shifts in a changing climate, and estimated extinction rates for eight major parasite clades. On the basis of 53, 133 occurrences capturing the geographic ranges of 457 parasite species, conservative model projections suggest that 5 to 10% of these species are committed to extinction by 2070 from climate-driven habitat loss alone. We find no evidence that parasites with zoonotic potential have a significantly higher potential to gain range in a changing climate, but we do find that ectoparasites (especially ticks) fare disproportionately worse than endoparasites. Accounting for host-driven coextinctions, models predict that up to 30% of parasitic worms are committed to extinction, driven by a combination of direct and indirect pressures. Despite high local extinction rates, parasite richness could still increase by an order of magnitude in some places, because species successfully tracking climate change invade temperate ecosystems and replace native species with unpredictable ecological consequences.

abstract={The possible role of climate change in late Quaternary animal extinctions is hotly debated, yet few studies have investigated its direct effects on animal physiology to assess whether past climate changes might have had significant impacts on now-extinct species. Here we test whether climate change could have imposed physiological stress on the Tasmanian devil Sarcophilus harrisii during the mid-Holocene, when the species went extinct on mainland Australia. Physiological values for the devil were quantified using mechanistic niche models of energy and water requirements for thermoregulation, and soil-moisture-based indices of plant stress from drought to indirectly represent food and water availability. The spatial pervasiveness, extremity and frequency of physiological stresses were compared between a period of known climatic and presumed demographic stability (8000–6010 BP) and the extinction period (5000–3010 BP). We found no evidence of widespread negative effects of climate on physiological parameters for the devil on the mainland during its extinction window. This leaves cultural and demographic changes in the human population or competition from the dingo Canis dingo as the main contending hypotheses to explain mainland loss of the devil in the mid-Holocene. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Abstract: The extinction risk assessment of a high altitude species with narrow distribution must primarily consider the intrinsic threats related to a small geographic range and to the effects of climate change on small scale. In this paper we estimated the current and future distribution of the narrow endemism of the Cottian Alps Carabus cychroides, one of the most localized ground beetles in Europe. This species was researched within the sites of historical presence and on the mountain ridges connected to them, recording its presence in new limited areas. The distribution of the species was modeled with fine-grained environmental variables with 25 m-resolution, in order to identify the presence of microrefugia and obtain an estimate as accurate as possible of the expected variation in geographic range. The results underline the faltering conservation status of C. cychroides, which in the most pessimistic greenhouse gas emissions scenario could become extinct at the end of the 21st century. Furthermore, its narrow distribution appears extremely fragmented and connectivity between suitable patches would decline rapidly in the coming decades. For these reasons and according to the IUCN Red List categories and criteria, we suggest that C. cychroides should be considered an endangered species. Implications for insect conservation: The assessment carried out in this study contributes to the distributive and ecological knowledge of one of the most localized ground beetles in Europe. The methodology used to model its distribution constitutes an helpful alternative to the more common use of coarse resolution variables, making possible the identification of potential microrefugia and therefore a more accurate estimation of the size, fragmentation and connectivity of the geographic range of a species that occupies such a small area. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Global climate change occurs from both natural and anthropic causes. Anthropic climate change has effects at various scales and occurs faster than the adaptation of species to these changes. Protected natural areas have been created to preserve species from the different threats facing them. Sierra La Laguna is a sky island with almost no anthropic pressure given its natural isolation; it is home to several endemic taxa, including Peromyscus truei lagunae and Sorex ornatus lagunae. This study aims to assess the possible impact of climate change on species endemic to a sky island exposed to virtually no local anthropic pressure. The Sierra La Laguna sky island, located in the southern region of the Baja California peninsula, harbors different vegetation types, including an oak-pine forest at the highest elevations and xeric vegetation at lower ones. Ecological niche models were developed under three climate change scenarios contemplating temperature rises of 1.5 °C and 4.4 °C. There are insufficient localities to make statistically robust models for mammalian species. Therefore, we used plant species typical of the oak-pine forest (Pinus cembroides lagunae, Quercus brandegeei, and Q. devia) and the rodents Peromyscus eva, that thrives in dry deciduous forests, and Chaetodipus rudinoris and C. spinatus, associated with xeric ecosystems. The models show that ecological suitability for the oak species decreases, while it is completely lost for the pine species. On the other hand, P. eva broadens its elevational range, while C. rudinoris and C. spinatus increase their ecological suitability in both area and elevation. The Sierra La Laguna sky island is an area with virtually no regional or local anthropic pressure. Nonetheless, the projections conducted under various climate change scenarios show a loss of up to 100 % of the area of climatic and elevational suitability for species characteristic of the oak-pine forest even with the minimum temperature rise of 1.5 °C. These results suggest that, under these conditions, endemic species such as P. t. lagunae and S. o. lagunae will become extinguished despite the absence of local anthropic pressures. © 2022 Asociación Mexicana de Mastozoología, www.mastozoologiamexicana.org.},

abstract={The fossil record can illuminate factors that contribute to extinction risk during times of global environmental disturbance; for example, inferred thermal tolerance was an important predictor of extinction during several mass extinctions that corresponded with climate change. Additionally, members of geographically isolated biotas may face higher risk because they have less opportunity to migrate to suitable climate refugia during environmental disturbances. Here, we investigate how different types of risk intersect in the well-preserved brachiopod fauna of the Appalachian Foreland Basin during the two pulses of the Frasnian–Famennian mass extinction (Late Devonian, ~ 372 Ma). The selectivity of extinction is consistent with climate change (cooling) as a primary kill mechanism in this fauna. Overall, the extinction was mild relative to other regions, despite the many endemic species. However, vulnerable taxa went extinct more rapidly, during the first extinction pulse, such that the second pulse was insignificant. These results suggest that vulnerable taxa in geographically isolated biotas face heightened extinction risk at the initiation of environmental stress, but that taxa in other regions may eventually see elevated extinction risk if environmental stress repeats or intensifies. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={The Late Ordovician (~459–444 million years ago) was characterized by global cooling, glaciation and severe mass extinction. These events may have been driven by increased delivery of the nutrient phosphorus (P) to the ocean and associated increases in marine productivity, but it is not clear why this occurred in the two pulses identified in the geological record. We link both cooling phases—and the extinction—to volcanic eruptions through marine deposition of nutrient-rich ash and the weathering of terrestrially emplaced ash and lava. We then reconstruct the influence of Late Ordovician volcanic P delivery on the marine system by coupling an estimate of bioavailable phosphate supply (derived from a depletion and weathering model) to a global biogeochemical model. Our model compares volcanic ash P content in marine sediments before and after alteration to determine depletion factors, and we find good agreement with observed carbon isotope and reconstructed temperature shifts. Hence, massive volcanism can drive substantial global cooling on million-year timescales due to P delivery associated with long-term weathering of volcanic deposits, offsetting the transient warming of greenhouse gas emission associated with volcanic eruptions. Such longer-term cooling and potential for marine eutrophication may be important for other volcanism-driven global events. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract={The tropical forests of Central America serve a pivotal role as biodiversity hotspots and provide ecosystem services securing human livelihood. However, climate change is expected to affect the species composition of forest ecosystems, lead to forest type transitions and trigger irrecoverable losses of habitat and biodiversity. Here, we investigate potential impacts of climate change on the environmental suitability of main plant functional types (PFTs) across Central America. Using a large database of occurrence records and physiological data, we classify tree species into trait-based groups and project their suitability under three representative concentration pathways (RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5) with an ensemble of state-of-the-art correlative modelling methods. Our results forecast transitions from wet towards generalist or dry forest PFTs for large parts of the study region. Moreover, suitable area for wet-adapted PFTs is projected to latitudinally diverge and lose connectivity, while expected upslope shifts of montane species point to high risks of mountaintop extinction. These findings underline the urgent need to safeguard the connectivity of habitats through biological corridors and extend protected areas in the identified transition hotspots. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Coastal areas host some of the planet’s most productive ecosystems, providing life-sustaining ecological services and several benefits to humankind, while also being some of the most threatened areas (e.g., by globalization, climate change, and biological invasion). Salt marshes are coastal habitats with a key role in food and shelter provisioning, sediment deposition, nutrient cycling and carbon storage. Spartina spp. is a genus of grass halophytes which occurs in salt marshes worldwide, and includes species with different invasive potential. We evaluated the effect of climate change in the distribution and invasion potential of five Spartina species (S. anglica, S. alterniflora, S. densiflora, S. patens, and S. maritima) at a global scale. Species distribution models (SDMs) were applied on species occurrence data and atmospheric environmental predictors (WorldClim 2.1) to project potential changes in habitat suitability and associated changes in distribution and species co-occurrence until the end of the century, across four Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (i.e., SSP1-2.6 to SSP5-8.5). Projections showed a global trend for increasing species co-occurrence, with a general range expansion potentiated by increasing pathway severity. This study suggests that Spartina species can potentially benefit from climate change, predicting poleward expansions in the Northern Hemisphere for most species, with results pointing at increased conflict and invasion potential in Northern Europe and East Asian shorelines, already under strong invasive pressure. S. anglica is projected to remain a successful invader, with more severe scenarios likely favoring greater expansions. S. alterniflora exhibits very low expansion comparatively, despite exhibiting the same northward distribution shift. SSP1-2.6 produced the smallest change to species co-occurrence, suggesting a smaller potential for invasion-related conflicts, although still registering a potential net expansion for the Genus. Despite their limitations, SDMs can help establish general trends in climate change ecology and inform policymakers and environmental agents to ensure the correct management of these habitats and, ultimately, ecosystems. © Copyright © 2021 Borges, Santos, Paula, Mateos-Naranjo, Redondo-Gomez, Adams, Caçador, Fonseca, Reis-Santos, Duarte and Rosa.},

abstract={The ongoing threat of climate change poses an increasing risk to biodiversity, especially for currently threatened species. Climate change can both directly impact species and interact with other pre-existing threats, such as habitat loss, to further amplify species' risk of extinction. Recognizing the threat of climate change in extinction risk assessments and recovery planning for imperilled species is essential for tailoring and prioritizing recovery actions for climate-threatened species. Using species legally listed in Canada we show that 44.1% of species' risk assessments identify the threat of climate change, nonetheless, 43.5% of assessments completely omit climate change. Species assessed more recently were more likely to be identified as climate-threatened, however, the strength of this relationship varied across taxonomic groups. The likelihood that climate change was identified as a threat was also strongly affected by the use of a standardized threat assessment process. Of the climate-threatened species, less than half (46.0%) of species' recovery plans specified actions aimed explicitly at minimizing climate impacts and only 3.8% of recovery plans recommended habitat or population management actions. Climate-targeted recovery actions were more likely to be included in more recent plans, and were marginally more likely for species where climate change was considered a major threat. Our findings highlight the urgent need for consistent and standardized assessments of the threat of climate change, including the consideration of potential synergies between climate change and other existing threats. Performing species-specific climate change vulnerability assessments may serve to complement existing assessment and recovery planning processes. We provide additional recommendations aimed at threatened species recovery planners for improving the integration of the threat of climate change into species extinction risk assessments and recovery planning processes for listed species. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Organisms respond to climate change in many different ways and their local extinction risk may vary widely among taxa. Crustaceans from freshwater temporary ponds produce resting eggs to cope with environmental uncertainty and, as a consequence, egg banks have a fundamental role for population persistence. The egg bank dynamics of six clonal lineages of Heterocypris incongruens (Ostracoda) from Northern Italy were simulated. Clonal lineages W1 and W2 are the most common “winter ecotypes”, clonal lineages S1 and S2 are allochthonous “summer ecotypes” and clonal lineages I1 and I2 are relatively rare and generalist in terms of seasonality. Fecundity and proportion of resting eggs vary by clonal lineage, temperature and photoperiod. The clonal extinction risk was estimated in present climate conditions and under climate change. For comparison, and to assess the potential colonization of northern ponds, clonal lineages from Lampedusa Island (Southern Italy), L, were considered. Cohen’s general model was used for simulating egg bank dynamics and the extinction rate of each clonal lineage was estimated with uncertainty analysis. A 30 year simulation in present and climate change conditions was carried out. Extinction rates were lower in climate change conditions than in present conditions. Hydroperiod, hatching rate and egg deterioration rate were the critical factors that affected extinction rates. Extinction rates varied among clonal lineages. This suggests that H. incongruens might be able to have multiple responses to climate change due to its genetic diversity. In climate change conditions, W clonal lineages underwent a niche expansion, while a mismatch between photoperiod and hydroperiod might generate a detrimental effect on the phenology of summer S clonal lineages that might cause their extinction. Southern clonal lineages L, showing an intermediate extinction rate, might colonize northern temporary ponds. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Assessing extinction risk from climate drivers is a major goal of conservation science. Few studies, however, include a long-term perspective of climate change. Without explicit integration, such long-term temperature trends and their interactions with short-term climate change may be so dominant that they blur or even reverse the apparent direct relationship between climate change and extinction. Here we evaluate how observed genus-level extinctions of arthropods, bivalves, cnidarians, echinoderms, foraminifera, gastropods, mammals and reptiles in the geological past can be predicted from the interaction of long-term temperature trends with short-term climate change. We compare synergistic palaeoclimate interaction (a short-term change on top of a long-term trend in the same direction) to antagonistic palaeoclimate interaction such as long-term cooling followed by short-term warming. Synergistic palaeoclimate interaction increases extinction risk by up to 40%. The memory of palaeoclimate interaction including the climate history experienced by ancestral lineages can be up to 60 Myr long. The effect size of palaeoclimate interaction is similar to other key factors such as geographic range, abundance or clade membership. Insights arising from this previously unknown driver of extinction risk might attenuate recent predictions of climate-change-induced biodiversity loss. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract={Accounting for population-level adaptation and migration remains a central challenge to predicting climate change effects on biodiversity. Assessing how climate change could disrupt local climate adaptation, resulting in maladaptation and possibly extirpation, can inform where climate change poses the greatest risks across species ranges. For the forest tree species balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera), we used climate-associated genetic loci to predict population maladaptation with and without migration, the distance to sites that minimize maladaptation, and the emergence of novel genotype–climate associations. We show that the greatest disruptions to contemporary genotype–climate associations occur along the longitudinal edges of the range, where populations are predicted to be maladapted to all future North American climates, rescue via migration is most limited and novel genotype–climate associations emerge. Our work advances beyond species-level range modelling towards the long-held goal of simultaneously estimating the contributions of maladaptation and migration to understanding the risks that populations may face from shifting climates. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract={Aim: Bogs and transition mires in Central Europe have undergone tremendous changes in the last decades, declining in spatial extent and favourable conservation status. However, species extinctions have been documented only rarely because of a lack of reliable floristic data. Here, we assessed species losses of bog complexes and analysed their potential drivers. Location: Black Forest, Germany. Methods: We made use of the unique situation that the majority of bogs in the Black Forest (124 sites) had been systematically surveyed from 1972 to 1980 and resurveyed the flora of the same sites between 2017 and 2020. In addition, we included further data from the preceding decades. Results: Out of 88 species for which we compiled site occupancy data, two species went extinct in the whole study area and 37 decreased from 1972 to 2020, losing on average 33% of their initial frequency. In contrast, 46 species displayed a positive trend. While decreasing species were characteristic of raised bogs, moorland ponds and base-rich mires, increasing species were typical of poor mires, fens and wet meadows. Species losses were higher at low elevation, pointing to increasing temperature increase and decreasing precipitation as main drivers of extinction, while habitat area, distance to the nearest site and land use played no significant role. The mean altitude at which extinctions of populations occurred increased with time. Assuming a continuation of the observed negative trends for declining bog species, our models predict the extinction of further ten species by 2045. Main Conclusion: Our study highlights the value of systematic and comprehensive past biodiversity surveys to assess biodiversity change. We demonstrated that low-mountain habitats have already suffered biodiversity loss as a result of climate change. There are only limited management options against rising temperatures and decreasing precipitation. © 2020 The Authors. Diversity and Distributions published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Under the framework of a “conservation biogeography” approach, initially, I reviewed and updated the taxonomy and distribution of the rich but understudied mammalian diversity of Iran. This data then formed the basis for the biogeographical regionalization of this complex transitional area using hierarchical clustering and infomap network methods. I used linear models to explore the correlates of extinction risk for this threatened mammalian fauna. Functional grouping of target species was used to assess their vulnerability to the magnitude and velocity of climate change impacts. Both clustering and network methods successfully illuminated the intricate biogeographic patterns, while the network detected many more small bioregions, including two transition zones. The extinction risk analyses revealed that direct human impacts through hunting and persecution played a major role in the decline of these taxa, as opposed to the minor effect of indirect and intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The magnitude and velocity of climate change impacts varied significantly between functional groups, with the highest risk of exposure to extreme climates in large and threatened species occurring in lowlands. This study provides a foundation for future biogeographic, systematics and ecological studies of Iranian mammals while simultaneously adding to the limited available information on the bioregionalization at regional scales. It also highlights the importance of incorporating threats in extinction risk models and functional trait information in climate change impact assessments. © the authors, CC-BY 4.0 license},

abstract={Climate change is an important driver of biodiversity loss and extinction of endemic montane species. In China, three endemic Juniperus spp. (Juniperus pingii var. pingii, J. tibetica, and J. komarovii) are threatened and subjected to the risk of extinction. This study aimed to predict the potential distribution of these three Juniperus species under climate change and dispersal scenarios, to identify critical drivers explaining their potential distributions, to assess the extinction risk by estimating the loss percentage in their area of occupancy (AOO), and to identify priority areas for their conservation in China. We used ensemble modeling to evaluate the impact of climate change and project AOO. Our results revealed that the projected AOOs followed a similar trend in the three Juniperus species, which predicted an entire loss of their suitable habitats under both climate and dispersal scenarios. Temperature annual range and isothermality were the most critical key variables explaining the potential distribution of these three Juniperus species; they contribute by 16–56.1% and 20.4–38.3%, respectively. Accounting for the use of different thresholds provides a balanced approach for species distribution models’ applications in conservation assessment when the goal is to assess potential climatic suitability in new geographical areas. Therefore, south Sichuan and north Yunnan could be considered important priority conservation areas for in situ conservation and search for unknown populations of these three Juniperus species. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Aim: Threats faced by narrowly distributed endemic plant species in the face of the Earth's sixth mass extinction and climate change exposure are especially severe for taxa on islands. We investigated the current and projected distribution and range changes of Cochemiea halei, an endemic island cactus. This taxon is of conservation concern, currently listed as vulnerable on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List and as a species of special concern under Mexican federal law. The goals of this study are to (a) identify the correlations between climate variables and current suitable habitat for C. halei; (b) determine whether the species is a serpentine endemic or has a facultative relationship with ultramafic soils; and (c) predict range changes of the species based on climate change scenarios. Location: The island archipelago in Bahía Magdalena on the Pacific coast, Baja California Sur, Mexico. Methods: We used temperature and precipitation variables at 30-arc second resolution and soil type, employing multiple species distribution modeling methods, to identify important climate and soil conditions driving current habitat suitability. The best model of current suitability is used to predict possible effects of four climate change scenarios based on best-case to worst-case representative concentration pathways, with projected climate data from two general circulation models, over two time periods. Main conclusions: The occurrence of the species is found to be strongly correlated with ultramafic soils. The most important climate predictor for habitat suitability is annual temperature range. The species is predicted to undergo range contractions from 21% to 53%, depending on the severity and duration of exposure to climate change. The broader implications for a wide range of narrowly adapted, threatened, and endemic plant species indicate an urgent need for threat assessment based on habitat suitability and climate change modeling. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Ongoing climate change is predicted to trigger major shifts in the geographic distribution of marine plankton species. However, it remains unclear whether species will successfully track optimal habitats to new regions, or face extinction. Here we show that one significant zooplankton group, the radiolaria, underwent a severe decline in high latitude species richness presaged by ecologic reorganization during the late Neogene, a time of amplified polar cooling. We find that the majority (71%) of affected species did not relocate to the warmer low latitudes, but went extinct. This indicates that some plankton species cannot track optimal temperatures on a global scale as assumed by ecologic models; instead, assemblages undergo restructuring and extinction once local environmental thresholds are exceeded. This pattern forewarns profound diversity loss of high latitude radiolaria in the near future, which may have cascading effects on the ocean food web and carbon cycle. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Climate change seriously threatens biodiversity, particularly in mountain ecosystems. However, studies on climate change effects rarely consider endemic species and their niche properties. Using species distribution models, we assessed the impact of climate change on the endemic flora of the richest centre of endemism in the Alps: the South-Western Alps. We projected the potential distributions of 100 taxa under both an optimistic (RCP2.6) and a pessimistic (RCP8.5) climate scenario, analysing the relationships between range dynamics and several predictors (dispersal abilities, vegetation belts, niche marginality, niche breadth, altitudinal range and present range). The negative impact ranged from weak to severe according to the scenario, but the extinction risk was low. The dispersal abilities of species strongly affected these range dynamics. Colline and subalpine species were the most threatened and the relationship between range dynamics and predictors varied among vegetation belts. Our results suggest that the rough topography of the SW Alps will probably buffer the climate change effects on endemics, especially if climate will remain within the limits already experienced by species during the Holocene. The presence of the Mediterranean-mountain flora, less affected by climate change than the alpine one, may explain the lower number of species threatened by extinction in the SW Alps than in other European mountains. These results suggest that the relationship between plants’ sensitivity to climate change, and both niche properties and vegetation belts, depends on the difference between the current climate in which species grow and the future climate, and not just on their niche breadth. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Public attention and interest in the fate of endangered species is a crucial prerequisite for effective conservation programs. Societal awareness and values will largely determine whether conservation initiatives receive necessary support and lead to adequate policy change. Using text data mining, we assessed general public attention in France, Germany and the United Kingdom toward climate change and biological invasions in relation to endangered amphibian, reptile, bird and mammal species. Our analysis revealed that public attention patterns differed among species groups and countries but was globally higher for climate change than for biological invasions. Both threats received better recognition in threatened than in non-threatened species, as well as in native species than in species from other countries and regions. We conclude that more efficient communication regarding the threat from biological invasions should be developed, and that conservation practitioners should take advantage of the existing attention toward climate change. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Large-scale changes in global climate at the end of the Pleistocene significantly impacted ecosystems across North America. However, the pace and scale of biotic turnover in response to both the Younger Dryas cold period and subsequent Holocene rapid warming have been challenging to assess because of the scarcity of well dated fossil and pollen records that covers this period. Here we present an ancient DNA record from Hall’s Cave, Texas, that documents 100 vertebrate and 45 plant taxa from bulk fossils and sediment. We show that local plant and animal diversity dropped markedly during Younger Dryas cooling, but while plant diversity recovered in the early Holocene, animal diversity did not. Instead, five extant and nine extinct large bodied animals disappeared from the region at the end of the Pleistocene. Our findings suggest that climate change affected the local ecosystem in Texas over the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary, but climate change on its own may not explain the disappearance of the megafauna at the end of the Pleistocene. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Mercury (Hg) anomalies linked to Large Igneous Provinces (LIP) volcanism have been identified in sediments across all five major mass extinctions in Earth's history. This study tests whether Hg in marine sediments is a reliable proxy linking Deccan Traps volcanic eruptions to late Maastrichtian global climate warming and the mass extinction at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary (KPB). Our primary test site is the Elles section in Tunisia, the auxiliary Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) to El Kef. Elles has the most complete marine sedimentary record and a high average sedimentation rate of ~4.7 cm/ky. We chose the Hor Hahar section in Israel to corroborate the geographic distribution of Hg fallout from Deccan volcanism. Reliability of the Hg proxy over the last 550 ky of the Maastrichtian to early Danian was evaluated based on high-resolution age control (orbital cyclostratigraphy), stable isotope climate record, Hg concentrations, biotic turnover and mass extinction. These results were correlated with the pulsed Deccan eruptive history constrained previously by U-Pb zircon geochronology. Our results support Hg as robust proxy for Deccan volcanism with large Hg spikes marking “extreme event” (EE) pulsed eruptions correlative with climate warming peaks separated by steady, less intense eruptions. Long-term global climate warming began near ~350 ky pre-KPB, reached maximum warming (3–4 °C) between 285 and 200 ky pre-KPB, followed by gradual cooling and rapid temperature drop between 45 and 25 ky pre-KPB. During the last 25 ky before the KPB, multiple Hg EE eruptions correlate with hyperthermal warming that culminated in the rapid mass extinction at Elles during ≤1000 years of the Cretaceous. These latest Cretaceous Hg peaks may correlate with massive, distal, Deccan-sourced lava flows (>1000 km long) that traversed the Indian subcontinent and flowed into the Bay of Bengal, bracketing the mass extinction. These results support Deccan volcanism as a primary driver of the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Climate change affects population cycles of several species, threatening biodiversity. However, there are few long-term studies on species with conservation issues and restricted distributions. Huemul is a deer endemic to the southern Andes in South America and it is considered endangered mostly due to a 50% reduction of its distribution over the last 500 years. To assess environmental variables potentially affecting huemul population viability and the impact of climate change, we developed population dynamics models. We used a 14-year survey data from Bernardo O’Higgins National Park, coastal Chilean Patagonia. We used Ricker models considering winter and spring temperatures and precipitation as variables influencing huemul population dynamics. We used the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to select models with the greatest predictive power. The two best models (ΔBIC &lt; 2) included winter temperature and density-dependence population growth drivers. The best model considered a lateral effect, where winter temperature influences carrying capacity and the second best a vertical effect with winter temperature influencing Rmax and carrying capacity. Population viability was evaluated using those models, projecting them over a 100-year period: (a) under current conditions and (b) under conditions estimated by Global Climate Models for 2050 and 2070. The extinction risk and quasi-extinction were estimated for this population considering two critical huemul abundance levels (15 and 30 individuals) for persistence. The population is currently in a quasi-extinction process, with extinction probabilities increasing with climate change. These results are crucial for conservation of species like huemul that have low densities and are threatened by climate change. © 2020, ISB.},

abstract={Achieving policy, business and behaviour change necessary to mitigate climate change is one of the most formidable challenges of the twenty-first century. Increasingly, researchers have argued that communicating purposively designed stories – ‘strategic narratives’ – may be effective in building support for the policy measures necessary to limit anthropogenic warming to 2˚C above pre-industrial levels. Recently, following the release of the IPCC's 1.5˚C special report, novel dynamics have emerged in climate strategic communication, with the emergence of new narrators, including youth climate strikers, child activist Greta Thunberg, and the insurgent group, Extinction Rebellion. Previous literature focuses mostly on narrative content and coherence, paying less attention to how a narrator's credibility affects climate change strategic narratives’ persuasiveness. Adopting this broader view, this paper analyses five strategic narratives that became prominent in the United Kingdom following the IPCC report. Contrary to some previous calls for all-encompassing strategic narratives communicated top-down from governmental organisations, the most notable strategic narratives in our sample emerged from civil society. We therefore call for greater attention towards the interaction of different narrators in climate change strategic communication, to address whether a broader range of narrators constrains or enables coordinated action to mitigate climate change. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={How species and ecosystems respond to the threatened environmental conditions are attracting phenomenon facing ecologists. One can expect species fight against these forces to get rid of extinction, i.e., species tend to adapt genetically or move to a new environment to resilience against extinction. In this paper, this problem is focused theoretically by considering a coupled of the oxygen-plankton model where planktons’ habitat changes and beachhead as a response to climate change. Hence, the dynamics of the oxygen-plankton model is considered assuming the spatial gradient of the growth rate of oxygen, in concern with altered sea surface temperature. It is observed that there exists a relationship between the slope of the gradient and the beachhead at which the oxygen-plankton system can stably survive, which can be defined by a simple function that separates the areas of extinction and persistence. Findings reveal that environmental gradient is an alternative way for species to create a new habitat and sustain the species persistence. Therefore, in this paper, it is shown that, in theory, the recovery of plankton extinction and oxygen depletion under climate change can be achieved by adding a spatial gradient. © 2020, Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Background: Was there a mid-Cenozoic vertebrate extinction and recovery event in Madagascar and, if so, what are its implications for the evolution of lemurs? The near lack of an early and mid-Cenozoic fossil record on Madagascar has inhibited direct testing of any such hypotheses. We compare the terrestrial vertebrate fauna of Madagascar in the Holocene to that of early Cenozoic continental Africa to shed light on the probability of a major mid-Cenozoic lemur extinction event, followed by an "adaptive radiation"or recovery. We also use multiple analytic approaches to test competing models of lemur diversification and the null hypothesis that no unusual mid-Cenozoic extinction of lemurs occurred. Results: Comparisons of the terrestrial vertebrate faunas of the early Cenozoic on continental Africa and Holocene on Madagascar support the inference that Madagascar suffered a major mid-Cenozoic extinction event. Evolutionary modeling offers some corroboration, although the level of support varies by phylogeny and model used. Using the lemur phylogeny and divergence dates generated by Kistler and colleagues, RPANDA and TESS offer moderate support for the occurrence of unusual extinction at or near the Eocene-Oligocene (E-O) boundary (34 Ma). TreePar, operating under the condition of obligate mass extinction, found peak diversification at 31 Ma, and low probability of survival of prior lineages. Extinction at the E-O boundary received greater support than other candidate extinctions or the null hypothesis of no major extinction. Using the lemur phylogeny and divergence dates generated by Herrera & Dàvalos, evidence for large-scale extinction diminishes and its most likely timing shifts to before 40 Ma, which fails to conform to global expectations. Conclusions: While support for large-scale mid-Cenozoic lemur extinction on Madagascar based on phylogenetic modeling is inconclusive, the African fossil record does provide indirect support. Furthermore, a major extinction and recovery of lemuriforms during the Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT) would coincide with other major vertebrate extinctions in North America, Europe, and Africa. It would suggest that Madagascar's lemurs were impacted by the climate shift from "greenhouse"to "ice-house"conditions that occurred at that time. This could, in turn, help to explain some of the peculiar characteristics of the lemuriform clade. © 2020 The Author(s).},

abstract={In recent years, carbon dioxide emissions have been potentiated by several anthropogenic processes that culminate in climate change, which in turn directly threatens biodiversity and the resilience of natural ecosystems. Tropical rainforests are among the most impacted biological realms. The Belém endemism center, which is one of the several endemism centers in Amazon, is located in the most affected area within the so-called “Deforestation Arc.” Moreover, this region harbors a high concentration of Amazonian endangered bird species, of which 56% of them are considered to be under the threat of extinction. In this work, we sought to evaluate the current and future impacts of both climate change and deforestation on the distribution of endemic birds in the Belém Area of Endemism (BEA). Thus, we generated species distribution models for the 16 endemic bird species considering the current and two future gas emission scenarios (optimistic and pessimistic). We also evaluated climate change impacts on these birds in three different dispersal contexts. Our results indicate that BAE, the endemic taxa will lose an average of 73% of suitable areas by 2050. At least six of these birds species will have less than 10% or no future suitable habitat in all emission scenarios. One of the main mechanisms used to mitigate the impacts of climate change on these species in the near future is to assess the current system of protected areas. It is necessary to ensure that these areas will continue being effective in conserving these species even under climate change. The “Gurupi Mosaic” and the “Rio-Capim” watershed are areas of great importance because they are considered climate refuges according to our study. Thus, conservation efforts should be directed to the maintenance and preservation of these two large remnants of vegetation in addition to creating ecological corridors between them. © 2020 de Moraes et al.

abstract={The long-term fate of populations experiencing disequilibrium conditions with their environment will ultimately depend on how local colonization and extinction dynamics respond to abiotic conditions (e.g. temperature and rainfall), dispersal limitation and biotic interactions (e.g. competition, facilitation or interactions with natural enemies). Understanding how these factors influence distributional dynamics under climate change is a major knowledge gap, particularly for small ranged and dispersal-limited plant species, which are at higher risk of extinction. Epiphytes are hypothesized to be particularly vulnerable to climate change and we know little about what drives their distribution and how they will respond to climate change. To address this issue, we leveraged a 10-year dataset on the occupancy dynamics of the endemic orchid Lepanthes rupestris to identify the drivers of local colonization and extinction dynamics and assess the long-term fate of this population under multiple climate change scenarios. We compared 290 dynamic occupancy models in their ability to predict the colonization and extinction dynamics of a L. rupestris metapopulation. The model set predicted colonization–extinction dynamics as a function of asymmetric patch connectivity, moss area, elevation, temperature (minimum, maximum and variability) and/or rainfall. The best model predicted that local colonization increases with increasing asymmetric patch connectivity but decreases as minimum temperature and maximum temperature variability increase. The best model also predicted that local extinction increases with increasing variability in maximum temperature. Negative effects were more severe in smaller patches. Synthesis. Overall, our results demonstrate the role of asymmetric connectivity, climate and interactions with moss area as drivers of colonization and extinction dynamics. Moreover, our results suggest that asymmetrically dispersed epiphytes may struggle to persist under climate change because their limited connectivity may not be enough to counterbalance the negative effects of increasing mean or variability in temperature. © 2020 British Ecological Society},

abstract={Anatomically Modern Humans are the sole survivor of a group of hominins that inhabited our planet during the last ice age and that included, among others, Homo neanderthalensis, Homo denisova, and Homo erectus. Whether previous hominin extinctions were triggered by external factors, such as abrupt climate change, volcanic eruptions or whether competition and interbreeding played major roles in their demise still remains unresolved. Here I present a spatially resolved numerical hominin dispersal model (HDM) with empirically constrained key parameters that simulates the migration and interaction of Anatomically Modern Humans and Neanderthals in the rapidly varying climatic environment of the last ice age. The model simulations document that rapid temperature and vegetation changes associated with Dansgaard-Oeschger events were not major drivers of global Neanderthal extinction between 50 and 35 thousand years ago, but played important roles regionally, in particular over northern Europe. According to a series of parameter sensitivity experiments conducted with the HDM, a realistic extinction of the Neanderthal population can only be simulated when Homo sapiens is chosen to be considerably more effective in exploiting scarce glacial food resources as compared to Neanderthals. © 2020 The Author(s)},

abstract={Climate change poses a threat to species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). A recent study on green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) at the northern Great Barrier Reef (GBR) showed a highly female-skewed sex ratio with almost all juvenile turtles being female. This shortage of males might eventually cause population extinction, unless rapid evolutionary rescue, migration, range shifts, or conservation efforts ensure a sufficient number of males. We built a stochastic individual-based model inspired by C. mydas but potentially transferrable to other species with TSD. Pivotal temperature, nest depth, and shading were evolvable traits. Additionally, we considered the effect of crossbreeding between northern and southern GBR, nest site philopatry, and conservation efforts. Among the evolvable traits, nest depth was the most likely to rescue the population, but even here the warmer climate change scenarios led to extinction. We expected turtles to choose colder beaches under rising temperatures, but surprisingly, nest site philopatry did not improve persistence. Conservation efforts promoted population survival and did not preclude trait evolution. Although extra information is needed to make reliable predictions for the fate of green sea turtles, our results illustrate how evolution can shape the fate of long lived, vulnerable species in the face of climate change. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Theaceae, an economically important angiosperm family, is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical forests in Asia. In China, Theaceae has particularly high abundances and endemism, comprising ~75% of the total genera and ~46% of the total species worldwide. Therefore, predicting the response of Theaceae species to climate change is vital. In this study, we collected distribution data for 200 wild Theaceae species in China, and predicted their distribution patterns under current and future climactic conditions by species distribution modeling (SDM). We revealed that Theaceae species richness is highest in southeastern China and on Hainan Island, reaching its highest value (137 species) in Fujian Province. According to the IUCN Red List criteria for assessing species threat levels under two dispersal assumptions (no dispersal and full dispersal), we evaluated the conservation status of all Theaceae species by calculating loss of suitable habitat under future climate scenarios. We predicted that nine additional species will become threatened due to climate change in the future; one species will be classified as critically endangered (CR), two as endangered (EN), and six as vulnerable (VU). Given their extinction risks associated with climate change, we recommended that these species be added to the Red List. Our investigation of migration patterns revealed regional differences in the number of emigrant, immigrant, and persistent species, indicating the need for targeted conservation strategies. Regions containing numerous emigrants are concentrated in Northern Taiwan and coastal regions of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, while regions containing numerous immigrants include central Sichuan Province, the southeastern Tibet Autonomous Region, southwest Yunnan Province, northwest Sichuan Province, and the junction of Guangxi and Hunan provinces. Lastly, regions containing persistent species are widely distributed in southern China. Importantly, regions with high species turnover are located on the northern border of the entire Theaceae species distribution ranges owing to upwards migration; these regions are considered most sensitive to climate change and conservation planning should therefore be prioritized here. This study will contribute valuable information for reducing the negative impacts of climate change on Theaceae species, which will ultimately improve biodiversity conservation efficiency. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Forecasting the impacts of climate change on species distribution has several implications for conservation. Plinia edulis is a rare and threatened tree species from Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest. In this study, we assessed the impact of global climate change on the distribution of P. edulis. Additionally, we evaluated the efficacy of the Brazilian protected network to conserve this species. Ecological niche models were built using the maximum entropy method based on occurrence records and environmental predictors. Models predicted a reduction of climatically suitable areas for P. edulis in all evaluated scenarios in the coming years. Furthermore, we observed that Brazilian protected areas (PAs) are ineffective to conserve this species. Given the fact that P. edulis is a promising tree species rarely found within Brazilian PAs and threatened by global climate change, we strongly recommend the cultivation of this multipurpose species in agroforestry systems, landscaping and homegardens in order to promote its conservation through sustainable use. © 2020 Ecological Society of Australia},

abstract={Stalagmite ANJ94-2 from Anjohibe Cave in northwestern Madagascar provides an exceptionally detailed and precisely dated record of changing environmental conditions that, combined with previously published data from stalagmites, wetland deposits, and archaeological sites, allows insights into past climate change, human environmental impact, and megafaunal extinction. Proxies of past conditions recovered from Stalagmite ANJ94-2 include ratios of carbon and oxygen stable isotopes (δ13C and δ18O), mineralogy (calcite and aragonite), layer-bounding surfaces, layer-specific width, and detrital material. Those proxies suggest that the natural environment changed in response to changes in rainfall at time scales of a few decades to multiple centuries; comparison with distant proxies suggests that wetter conditions in northwestern Madagascar may have been linked to cooling in the Northern Hemisphere. Carbon isotope data nonetheless suggest that the greatest environmental change in the area coincided with human introduction of swidden (tavy) agriculture about 1200 years ago, during a time not of drought but perhaps of slightly increasing wetness. The timing and extent of environmental change 1200 to 600 years ago seen in stalagmite and wetland data suggest that human modification of the landscape had a causal role in the extinction of Madagascar's megafauna. On the other hand, the results combine with other recent research to indicate that drought was not the cause of the megafaunal extinction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Climate change may be a major threat to biodiversity in the next 100 years. Although there has been important work on mechanisms of decline in some species, it generally remains unclear which changes in climate actually cause extinctions, and how many species will likely be lost. Here, we identify the specific changes in climate that are associated with the widespread local extinctions that have already occurred. We then use this information to predict the extent of future biodiversity loss and to identify which processes may forestall extinction. We used data from surveys of 538 plant and animal species over time, 44% of which have already had local extinctions at one or more sites. We found that locations with local extinctions had larger and faster changes in hottest yearly temperatures than those without. Surprisingly, sites with local extinctions had significantly smaller changes in mean annual temperatures, despite the widespread use of mean annual temperatures as proxies for overall climate change. Based on their past rates of dispersal, we estimate that 57–70% of these 538 species will not disperse quickly enough to avoid extinction. However, we show that niche shifts appear to be far more important for avoiding extinction than dispersal, although most studies focus only on dispersal. Specifically, considering both dispersal and niche shifts, we project that only 16–30% of these 538 species may go extinct by 2070. Overall, our results help identify the specific climatic changes that cause extinction and the processes that may help species to survive. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Habitat transformation and loss is one of the greatest threats currently facing avian species. The cumulative impact of climate change on habitat loss is projected to produce disproportionate risk for endemic high-altitude species. The Southern Bald Ibis (Geronticus calvus) is an endemic high-altitude species found throughout highland grassland habitats in South Africa and Lesotho. The historical distribution has contracted notably and causal factors remain ambiguous. Furthermore, the historical population (1950-1970) was believed to be stable, but recent local surveys suggest colony declines and the current global population status remains largely unquantified. We assessed the current distribution and population status of the species through predictive modeling and trends in historical and recent colony counts across the species' range. We examined climate and habitat change as potential causal factors contributing to the historical contraction in distribution, and projected the potential impact of future climate change predicted by global circulation models. Our study confirms that Southern Bald Ibis are of conservation concern. The loss of grasslands to expanding woody vegetation through bush encroachment was the most detrimental habitat transformation type associated with decreased colony growth and colony collapse. We recommend maintaining a minimum threshold of 50% or greater intact grassland habitat surrounding colonies to reduce colony extinction risk and promote colony persistence.

abstract={The causes of the severest crisis in the history of life around the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) remain controversial. Here we report that the latest Permian alluvial plains in Shanxi, North China, went through a rapid transition from meandering rivers to braided rivers and aeolian systems. Soil carbonate carbon isotope (δ13C), oxygen isotope (δ18O), and geochemical signatures of weathering intensity reveal a consistent pattern of deteriorating environments (cool, arid, and anoxic conditions) and climate fluctuations across the PTB. The synchronous ecological collapse is confirmed by a dramatic reduction or disappearance of dominant plants, tetrapods and invertebrates and a bloom of microbially-induced sedimentary structures. A similar rapid switch in fluvial style is seen worldwide (e.g. Karoo Basin, Russia, Australia) in terrestrial boundary sequences, all of which may be considered against a background of global marine regression. The synchronous global expansion of alluvial fans and high-energy braided streams is a response to abrupt climate change associated with aridity, hypoxia, acid rain, and mass wasting. Where neighbouring uplands were not uplifting or basins subsiding, alluvial fans are absent, but in these areas the climate change is evidenced by the disruption of pedogenesis. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={Climate change is among the most important drivers of biodiversity decline through shift or shrinkage in suitable habitat of species. Mountain vipers of the genus Montivipera are under extreme risk from climate changes given their evolutionary history and geographic distribution. In this study, we divided all Montivipera species into three phylogenetic-geographic Montivipera clades (PGMC; Bornmuelleri, Raddei and Xanthina) and applied an ensemble ecological niche modelling (ENM) approach under different climatic scenarios to assess changes in projected suitable habitats of these species. Based on the predicted range losses, we assessed the projected extinction risk of the species relative to IUCN Red List Criteria. Our result revealed a strong decline in suitable habitats for all PGMCs (63.8%, 79.3% and 96.8% for Xanthina, Raddei and Bornmuelleri, respectively, by 2070 and under 8.5 RCP scenario) with patterns of altitudinal range shifts in response to projected climate change. We found that the mountains close to the Mediterranean Sea are exposed to the highest threats in the future (84.6 ± 9.1 percent range loss). We also revealed that disjunct populations of Montivipera will be additionally highly isolated and fragmented in the future. We argue that leveraging climate niche projections into the risk assessment provides the opportunity to implement IUCN criteria and better assess forthcoming extinction risks of species. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={The Younger Dryas (YD) impact hypothesis posits that fragments of a large, disintegrating asteroid/comet struck North America, South America, Europe, and western Asia ~12,800 years ago. Multiple airbursts/impacts produced the YD boundary layer (YDB), depositing peak concentrations of platinum, high-temperature spherules, meltglass, and nanodiamonds, forming an isochronous datum at >50 sites across ~50 million km² of Earth’s surface. This proposed event triggered extensive biomass burning, brief impact winter, YD climate change, and contributed to extinctions of late Pleistocene megafauna. In the most extensive investigation south of the equator, we report on a ~12,800-year-old sequence at Pilauco, Chile (~40°S), that exhibits peak YD boundary concentrations of platinum, gold, high-temperature iron- and chromium-rich spherules, and native iron particles rarely found in nature. A major peak in charcoal abundance marks an intense biomass-burning episode, synchronous with dramatic changes in vegetation, including a high-disturbance regime, seasonality in precipitation, and warmer conditions. This is anti-phased with northern-hemispheric cooling at the YD onset, whose rapidity suggests atmospheric linkage. The sudden disappearance of megafaunal remains and dung fungi in the YDB layer at Pilauco correlates with megafaunal extinctions across the Americas. The Pilauco record appears consistent with YDB impact evidence found at sites on four continents. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is one of the most important of all conservation indicators, but most developing countries do not have enough information with which to make assessments. The use of species distribution models (SDMs) to predict habitat suitability, both currently and in the future under the effects of climate change, offers a potential solution for estimating extinction risk. With a set of validated observations, we used SDMs to make preliminary evaluations of the risk of extinction for 114 Egyptian medicinal plants based on IUCN Red-List Criteria and Categories. Using MaxEnt and eleven environmental variables, distributions were projected for 2020, 2050, and 2080 under two emission scenarios (A2a and B2a) assuming unlimited and no dispersal. The IUCN assessments used the predicted distributions as well as the actual records to measure both extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO). There was a positive correlation between EOO estimates based on actual records and those based on SDMs, demonstrating the ability of SDMs to compensate for a lack of data. Most species could be classified as Least Concern (LC) at the current time, whilst in the future under climate change, many species face some risk of extinction, depending on assumptions. We conclude that it is possible to make regional risk assessments even in data-sparse countries, in order to plan conservation management in the future. Using species distribution modelling together with IUCN Red-List assessment is a good method for countries where data are sparse in order to conserve and protect threatened species. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Loss of biological diversity through population extinctions is a global phenomenon that threatens many ecosystems. Managers often rely on databases of rare species locations to plan land use actions and conserve at-risk taxa, so it is crucial that the information they contain is accurate and dependable. However, small population sizes, long gaps between surveys, and climate change may be leading to undetected extinctions of many populations. We used repeated survey records for a rare but widespread orchid, Cypripedium fasciculatum (clustered lady’s slipper), to model population extinction risk based on elevation, population size, and time between observations. Population size and elevation were negatively associated with extinction, while extinction probability increased with time between observations. We interpret population losses at low elevations as a potential signal of climate change impacts. We used this model to estimate the probability of persistence of populations across California and Oregon, and found that 39%-52% of the 2415 populations reported in databases from this region are likely extinct. Managers should be aware that the number of populations of rare species in their databases is potentially an overestimate, and consider resurveying these populations to document their presence and condition, with priority given to older reports of small populations, especially those at low elevations or in other areas with high vulnerability to climate or land cover change.

abstract={Accelerated anthropogenic impacts and climatic changes are widely considered to be responsible for unprecedented species extinction. However, determining their effects on extinction is challenging owing to the lack of long-term data with high spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, using historical occurrence records of 11 medium- to large-sized mammal species or groups of species in China from 905 BC to AD 2006, we quantified the distinctive associations of anthropogenic stressors (represented by cropland coverage and human population density) and climatic stressors (represented by air temperature) with the local extinction of these mammals. We found that both intensified human disturbances and extreme climate change were associated with the increased local extinction of the study mammals. In the cold phase (the premodern period of China), climate cooling was positively associated with increased local extinction, while in the warm phase (the modern period) global warming was associated with increased local extinction. Interactive effects between human disturbance and temperature change with the local extinction of elephants, rhinos, pandas, and water deer were found. Large-sized mammals, such as elephants, rhinos, and pandas, showed earlier and larger population declines than small-sized ones. The local extinction sensitivities of these mammals to the human population density and standardized temperature were estimated during 1700 to 2000. The quantitative evidence for anthropogenic and climatic associations with mammalian extinction provided insights into the driving processes of species extinction, which has important implications for biodiversity conservation under accelerating global changes. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

abstract={Cave bears (Ursus spelaeus) are an iconic component of the European late Quaternary Ice Age megafauna. Recent demographic analyses based on cave bear mtDNA sequences and refined radiocarbon dating indicate that cave bear population size and genetic diversity started to decline some 50 kilo years ago (kya). Hence, neither the coldest phase of the last glaciation (started some 24 kya), nor the colonization of Europe by Palaeolithic hunters (started some 45 kya) coincides with the beginning of population decline. Here, we reconstructed cave bear climatic niche evolution through time. Then, we performed spatially explicit population viability analyses to assess cave bear demographics through time in response to climatic changes, human effects on bear survival and their combination. We found that climate change was responsible for a 10-fold decrease in cave bear population size after 40 kya. However, climate change on its own could not explain U. spelaeus extinction at 24 kya. Additional negative effects consistent with human population expansion are required to explain both U. spelaeus' retreat from eastern Europe since 40 kya and its final extinction. © 2019 Collegium Boreas.

abstract={Around the world, many species are confined to “Sky Islands,” with different populations in isolated patches of montane habitat. How does this pattern arise? One scenario is that montane species were widespread in lowlands when climates were cooler, and were isolated by local extinction caused by warming conditions. This scenario implies that many montane species may be highly susceptible to anthropogenic warming. Here, we test this scenario in a montane lizard (Sceloporus jarrovii) from the Madrean Sky Islands of southeastern Arizona. We combined data from field surveys, climate, population genomics, and physiology. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that this species' current distribution is explained by local extinction caused by past climate change. However, our results for this species differ from simple expectations in several ways: (a) their absence at lower elevations is related to warm winter temperatures, not hot summer temperatures; (b) they appear to exclude a low-elevation congener from higher elevations, not the converse; (c) they are apparently absent from many climatically suitable but low mountain ranges, seemingly “pushed off the top” by climates even warmer than those today; (d) despite the potential for dispersal among ranges during recent glacial periods (~18,000 years ago), populations in different ranges diverged ~4.5–0.5 million years ago and remained largely distinct; and (e) body temperatures are inversely related to climatic temperatures among sites. These results may have implications for many other Sky Island systems. More broadly, we suggest that Sky Island species may be relevant for predicting responses to future warming. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Stalagmite data from Anjohibe Cave in northwest Madagascar suggest six distinct climate periods from 9.1 to 0.94 ka. Periods I and II (9.1–4.9 ka) were wetter and punctuated by a series of prominent droughts. Periods IV-VI (4–0.94 ka) were much drier and less variable. Period III (4.9-4 ka) marks the transition between wetter and drier conditions and consists of two significant droughts: the first (4.8–4.6 ka) coincides approximately with the end of the African Humid Period and the second (4.3–4.0 ka) may be the expression of the Northern Hemisphere 4.2 ka dry event in northwest Madagascar. Strong positive correlations between δ 13 C and δ 18 O values in Periods I-IV (r = 0.63–0.91) suggest that both isotopes were influenced by natural climate changes indicating that humans may not have been present in the area. In contrast, during Periods V (r = 0.07) and VI (r = −0.12) the “decoupling” of δ 13 C and δ 18 O might signal an impact from human activities starting around 2.5 ka. Rapid changes in climate during the early and middle Holocene, with prominent droughts lasting up to 800 years, did not kill off Madagascar's megafauna, and neither did a human population, present since the early Holocene if evidence from south Madagascar is reliable. However, many extinctions occurred under the more stable climatic conditions of the late Holocene, despite an antiphase climate relationship between northern and southcentral Madagascar. This suggests that initial human colonization, or significant increase in human population, triggered the megafaunal extinctions by hunting and destruction of megafaunal habitats. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Geologically rapid climate change is anticipated to increase extinction risk nonuniformly across the Earth's surface. Tropical species may be more vulnerable than temperate species to current climate warming because of high tropical climate velocities and reduced seawater oxygen levels. To test whether rapid warming indeed preferentially increased the extinction risk of tropical fossil taxa, we combine a robust statistical assessment of latitudinal extinction selectivity (LES) with the dominant views on climate change occurring at ancient extinction crises. Using a global data set of marine fossil occurrences, we assess extinction rates for tropical and temperate genera, applying log ratios to assess effect size and Akaike weights for model support. Among the classical big five mass extinction episodes, the end-Permian mass extinction exhibits temperate preference of extinctions, whereas the Late Devonian and end-Triassic selectively hit tropical genera. Simple links between the inferred direction of climate change and LES are idiosyncratic, both during crisis and background intervals. More complex models, including sampling patterns and changes in the latitudinal distribution of continental shelf area, show tropical LES to be generally associated with raised tropical heat and temperate LES with global cold temperatures. With implications for the future, our paper demonstrates the consistency of high tropical temperatures, habitat loss, and the capacity of both to interact in generating geographic patterns in extinctions.

abstract={Arabica coffee (Coffea arabica) is a key crop in many tropical countries and globally provides an export value of over US$13 billion per year. Wild Arabica coffee is of fundamental importance for the global coffee sector and of direct importance within Ethiopia, as a source of harvestable income and planting stock. Published studies show that climate change is projected to have a substantial negative influence on the current suitable growing areas for indigenous Arabica in Ethiopia and South Sudan. Here we use all available future projections for the species based on multiple general circulation models (GCMs), emission scenarios, and migration scenarios, to predict changes in Extent of Occurrence (EOO), Area of Occupancy (AOO), and population numbers for wild Arabica coffee. Under climate change our results show that population numbers could reduce by 50% or more (with a few models showing over 80%) by 2088. EOO and AOO are projected to decline by around 30% in many cases. Furthermore, present-day models compared to the near future (2038), show a reduction for EOO of over 40% (with a few cases over 50%), although EOO should be treated with caution due to its sensitivity to outlying occurrences. When applying these metrics to extinction risk, we show that the determination of generation length is critical. When applying the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red list of Threatened Species (IUCN Red List) criteria, even with a very conservative generation length of 21 years, wild Arabica coffee is assessed as Threatened with extinction (placed in the Endangered category) under a broad range of climate change projections, if no interventions are made. Importantly, if we do not include climate change in our assessment, Arabica coffee is assessed as Least Concern (not threatened) when applying the IUCN Red List criteria. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Climate change (CC) could cause the extinction of 20% of the lizard species in the world by the year 2080. However, extinction risk is variable among species and it depends on the physiological requirements of individuals and the geographic distribution of populations. In this study, we evaluated thermal ecological aspects of a population of the diurnal gecko Gonatodes concinnatus, that inhabits in the western region of the Amazon Rainforest, and projected its potential distribution at present and his extinction risk by the year 2050 and by 2070 through a mechanistic and correlative model. We found out that G. concinnatus had a body temperature (Tb) of 26.8 °C (± 2.5), a selected body temperature (Tsel) of 24.6 °C (± 1.6) and a tendency towards thermoconformism. The probability of extinction for G. concinnatus is 84.2% by 2050 and 86.4% by 2070. Additionally, we estimated that at lower elevations, populations will have higher extinction probabilities due to CC. We consider G. concinnatus as highly sensitive to CC and we highlight the importance of having information on the thermal physiology of tropical ectotherms to implement appropriate conservation strategies. © 2019 Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

abstract={In a world where changes in land cover and climate happen faster than ever due to the expansion of human activities, narrowly distributed species are predicted to be the first to go extinct. Studies projecting species extinction in tropical regions consider either habitat loss or climate change as drivers of biodiversity loss but rarely evaluate them together. Here, the contribution of these two factors to the extinction risk of narrowly distributed species (with ranges smaller than 10,000 km2) of seed plants endemic to a fifth-order watershed in Brazil (microendemics) is assessed. We estimated the Regional Climate Change Index (RCCI) of these watersheds (areas with microendemics) and projected three scenarios of land use up to the year 2100 based on the average annual rates of habitat loss in these watersheds from 2000 to 2014. These scenarios correspond to immediate conservation action (scenario 1), long-term conservation action (scenario 2), and no conservation action (scenario 3). In each scenario, areas with microendemics were classified into four classes: (1) areas with low risk, (2) areas threatened by habitat loss, (3) areas threatened by climate change, and (4) areas threatened by climate change and habitat loss. We found 2,354 microendemic species of seed plants in 776 areas that altogether cover 17.5% of Brazil. Almost 70% (1,597) of these species are projected to be under high extinction risk by the end of the century due to habitat loss, climate change, or both, assuming that these areas will not lose habitat in the future due to land use. However, if habitat loss in these areas continues at the prevailing annual rates, the number of threatened species is projected to increase to more than 85% (2,054). The importance of climate change and habitat loss as drivers of species extinction varies across phytogeographic domains, and this variation requires the adoption of retrospective and prospective conservation strategies that are context specific. We suggest that tropical countries, such as Brazil, should integrate biodiversity conservation and climate change policies (both mitigation and adaptation) to achieve win-win social and environmental gains while halting species extinction. © 2019 Silva et al.},

abstract={Montane species worldwide are shifting upslope in response to recent temperature increases. These upslope shifts are predicted to lead to mountaintop extinctions of species that live only near mountain summits, but empirical examples of populations that have disappeared are sparse. We show that recent warming constitutes an “escalator to extinction” for birds on a remote Peruvian mountain—high-elevation species have declined in both range size and abundance, and several previously common mountaintop residents have disappeared from the local community. Our findings support projections that warming will likely drive widespread extirpations and extinctions of high-elevation taxa in the tropical Andes. Such climate change-driven mountaintop extirpations may be more likely in the tropics, where temperature seems to exert a stronger control on species’ range limits than in the temperate zone. In contrast, we show that lowland bird species at our study site are expanding in range size as they shift their upper limits upslope and may thus benefit from climate change. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

abstract={Climate forcing, which is blamed for the decennial decline in the dynamics of vole populations in Central and Northern Europe, may have similar effects in southern (Mediterranean) Europe, even more so since the region is especially vulnerable to global change. In the absence of population monitoring, we investigated the temporal development and geospatial pattern of the habitat of Harting’s vole (Microtus hartingi) in southeast Europe (SEE) by relying on data regarding its presence, the most recent freely available geospatial datasets and state-of-the-art presence-only Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) techniques. Results indicate that (1) the potential habitat of Harting’s vole was perhaps stable over the last 6000 years - modelling predictions are in conjunction with scarce fossil evidence, which points to repeated colonisations from Asia Minor punctuated by extinctions in SEE; (2) fragmentation of the potential habitat in SEE, which may have already begun in the Last Glacial Maximum, and will most likely continue in the near future; and (3) Harting’s vole could disappear by the end of the century if more pessimistic climate change scenarios become reality. While climate change is suppressing the population dynamics of the keystone grass-eating voles from temperate and boreal ecosystems, it is about to annihilate their Mediterranean counterpart. This will result in a far more severe impact on community restructuring in the Mediterranean ecosystems than elsewhere. Long-term population monitoring is desperately needed in SEE to hone the ability to more accurately predict the impacts of climate change. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Land-cover and climate change are two main drivers of changes in species ranges. Yet, the majority of studies investigating the impacts of global change on biodiversity focus on one global change driver and usually use simulations to project biodiversity responses to future conditions. We conduct an empirical test of the relative and combined effects of land-cover and climate change on species occurrence changes. Specifically, we examine whether observed local colonization and extinctions of North American birds between 1981–1985 and 2001–2005 are correlated with land-cover and climate change and whether bird life history and ecological traits explain interspecific variation in observed occurrence changes. We fit logistic regression models to test the impact of physical land-cover change, changes in net primary productivity, winter precipitation, mean summer temperature, and mean winter temperature on the probability of Ontario breeding bird local colonization and extinction. Models with climate change, land-cover change, and the combination of these two drivers were the top ranked models of local colonization for 30%, 27%, and 29% of species, respectively. Conversely, models with climate change, land-cover change, and the combination of these two drivers were the top ranked models of local extinction for 61%, 7%, and 9% of species, respectively. The quantitative impacts of land-cover and climate change variables also vary among bird species. We then fit linear regression models to test whether the variation in regional colonization and extinction rate could be explained by mean body mass, migratory strategy, and habitat preference of birds. Overall, species traits were weakly correlated with heterogeneity in species occurrence changes. We provide empirical evidence showing that land-cover change, climate change, and the combination of multiple global change drivers can differentially explain observed species local colonization and extinction. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

To inform predator restoration efforts on Kangaroo Island (South Australia) we examined the survival histories and potential extirpation factors of large marsupial carnivores that previously occurred on Kangaroo Island, King Island and Flinders Island, located off the southern coastline of the Australian mainland. Through a review of historical accounts and fossil evidence, we determined that the pattern of species persistence and extirpation on Kangaroo Island parallels that observed on King and Flinders Islands. Fossil data supports the terminal Pleistocene–early Holocene extinction of the thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus) from Kangaroo Island and the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) from both Kangaroo and Flinders Islands. Though eastern quoll (Dasyurus viverrinus) fossils have been found on both Kangaroo and Flinders Islands, and western quoll (D. geoffroii) on Kangaroo Island, contemporary evidence for their post-European persistence is unclear. In contrast, fossil, museum and anecdotal data supports the presence of the spotted-tailed quoll (D. maculatus) on all three islands and, contrary to established knowledge, its post-European persistence on Kangaroo Island. The loss of T. cynocephalus, S. harrisii, D. geoffroii and D. viverrinus from these islands appears to be commensurate with late to terminal Pleistocene–early Holocene climate change and associated changes in vegetation communities. In contrast, anthropogenic persecution of D. maculatus appears to be the principal cause of its post-European extirpation. We recommend D. maculatus as a suitable candidate marsupial carnivore for reintroduction to Kangaroo Island. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Pathogens are a significant component of all plant communities. In recent years, the potential for existing and emerging pathogens of agricultural crops to cause increased yield losses as a consequence of changing climatic patterns has raised considerable concern. In contrast, the response of naturally occurring, endemic pathogens to a warming climate has received little attention. Here, we report on the impact of a signature variable of global climate change – increasing temperature – on the long-term epidemiology of a natural host–pathogen association involving the rust pathogen Triphragmium ulmariae and its host plant Filipendula ulmaria. In a host–pathogen metapopulation involving approximately 230 host populations growing on an archipelago of islands in the Gulf of Bothnia we assessed changes in host population size and pathogen epidemiological measures over a 25-year period. We show how the incidence of disease and its severity declines over that period and most importantly demonstrate a positive association between a long-term trend of increasing extinction rates in individual pathogen populations of the metapopulation and increasing temperature. Our results are highly suggestive that changing climatic patterns, particularly mean monthly growing season (April-November) temperature, are markedly influencing the epidemiology of plant disease in this host–pathogen association. Given the important role plant pathogens have in shaping the structure of communities, changes in the epidemiology of pathogens have potentially far-reaching impacts on ecological and evolutionary processes. For these reasons, it is essential to increase understanding of pathogen epidemiology, its response to warming, and to invoke these responses in forecasts for the future. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Extinction rates are predicted to rise exponentially under climate warming, but many of these predictions ignore physiological and behavioral plasticity that might buffer species from extinction. We evaluated the potential for physiological acclimatization and behavioral avoidance of poor climatic conditions to lower extinction risk under climate change in the global hotspot of salamander diversity, a region currently predicted to lose most of the salamander habitat due to warming. Our approach integrated experimental physiology and behavior into a mechanistic species distribution model to predict extinction risk based on an individual’s capacity to maintain energy balance with and without plasticity. We assessed the sensitivity of extinction risk to body size, behavioral strategies, limitations on energy intake, and physiological acclimatization of water loss and metabolic rate. The field and laboratory experiments indicated that salamanders readily acclimatize water loss rates and metabolic rates in ways that could maintain positive energy balance. Projections with plasticity reduced extinction risk by 72% under climate warming, especially in the core of their range. Further analyses revealed that juveniles might experience the greatest physiological stress under climate warming, but we identified specific physiological adaptations or plastic responses that could minimize the lethal physiological stress imposed on juveniles. We conclude that incorporating plasticity fundamentally alters ecological predictions under climate change by reducing extinction risk in the hotspot of salamander diversity.

abstract={Determining the susceptibility of species to changing thermal niches is a major goal for biologists. In this paper we develop an eco-physiological model of extinction risk under climate change premised on behavioral thermoregulation. Our method downscales operative environmental temperatures, which restrict hours of activity of lizards, hr, for present-day climate (1975) and future climate scenarios (2070). We apply our model using occurrence records of 20 Phrynocephalus lizards (or taxa in species complexes) drawn from literature and museum records. Our analysis is phylogenetically informed, because some clades may be more sensitive to rising temperatures. The limits for computed hr predict local extirpations among Phrynocephalus lizards at continental scales and delineate upper boundaries of thermal niches as defined by Extreme Value Distributions. Under the 8.5 Representative Concentration Pathway scenario, we predict extirpation of 64% of local populations by 2070 across 20 Phrynocephalus species, and 12 are at high risk of total extinction due to thermal limits being exceeded. In tandem with global strategies of lower CO2 emissions, we propose regional strategies for establishing new national parks to protect extinction-prone taxa by preserving high-elevation climate refugia within existing sites of species occurrence. We propose that evolved acclimatization — maternal plasticity — may ameliorate risk, but is poorly studied. Previous studies revealed that adaptive maternal plasticity by thermoregulating gravid females alter progeny thermal preferences by ±1 °C. We describe plasticity studies for extinction-prone species that could assess whether they might be buffered from climate warming — a self-rescue. We discuss an epigenetic framework for studying such maternal-effect evolution. © 2018 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd},

abstract={Climate change can have significant impacts on the survival of plant species. However, it is seldom included in the assessment of the extinction risk according to IUCN Red List criteria. Lack of data and uncertainties of predictions make difficult such inclusion. In our paper we present an approach, in which the effect of climate change on plant species spatial distribution is used to prioritize conservation within IUCN categories. We used, as a case study, 37 Italian policy species, relevant for conservation, and listed in the Habitat Directive and Bern Convention, and for which a Red List (RL) assessment was available. A stochastic SDM incorporating data on plant dispersal, generation length, and habitat fragmentation was used to predict a range shift due to climate change according to two climatic scenarios (RCP 2.6 and 8.5). No species was predicted to become extinct in the considered timespans (2050 and 2070) due to climate change, and only two were characterized by critical decline probabilities. However, all taxa were potentially affected by climate change through a reduction of their range. In all RL categories, species with the highest predicted reduction of range were those from lowlands, where fragmentation of natural habitats has occurred in the last decades. In these cases, despite some limitations, assisted migration can be considered a suitable conservation option. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={Aim: Climate change affects forest functioning not only through direct physiological effects such as modifying photosynthesis and growing season lengths, but also through indirect effects on community composition related to species extinctions and colonizations. Such indirect effects remain poorly explored in comparison with the direct ones. Biodiversity–ecosystem functioning (BEF) studies commonly examine the effects of species loss by eliminating species randomly. However, species extinctions caused by climate change will depend on the species’ vulnerability to the new environmental conditions, thus occurring in a specific, non-random order. Here, we evaluated whether successive tree species extinctions, according to their vulnerability to climate change, impact forest functions differently than random species losses. Location: Eleven temperate forests across a gradient of climatic conditions in central Europe. Methods: We simulated tree community dynamics with a forest succession model to study the impact of species loss on the communities’ aboveground biomass, productivity and temporal stability. Tree species were removed from the local pool (1) randomly, and according to (2) their inability to be recruited under a warmer climate or (3) their increased mortality under drier conditions. Results: Results showed that non-random species loss (i.e., based on their vulnerability to warmer or drier conditions) changed forest functioning at a different rate, and sometimes direction, than random species loss. Furthermore, directed extinctions, unlike random, triggered tipping points along the species loss process where forest functions were strongly impacted. These tipping points occurred after fewer extinctions in forests located in the coldest areas, where ecosystem functioning relies on fewer species. Main conclusions: We showed that the extinction of species in a deterministic and mechanistically motivated order, in this case the species vulnerability to climate change, strengthens the selection effect of diversity on ecosystem functioning. BEF studies exploring the impact of species loss on ecosystem functioning using random extinctions thus possibly underestimate the potential effect of biodiversity loss when driven by a directional force, such as climate change. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={The Late Ordovician mass extinction (LOME, ca. 445 Ma) was the first of the "Big Five" Phanerozoic extinction events and comprised two extinction pulses. Proposed kill mechanisms include glacially induced global cooling and the expansion of water-column anoxia and/or euxinia (sulfidic conditions), but no general consensus has been reached with regard to the precise role of these mechanisms. A more definitive understanding is hampered by poorly constrained temporal links between the extinction pulses and climate change, and by uncertainty over the spatial distribution and intensity of euxinia. Here, we utilize Fe speciation and Mo concentrations, in addition to the chemical index of alteration weathering proxy, to reconstruct ocean redox conditions and climate change across a Late Ordovician to Early Silurian shelf-to-slope transect on the Yangtze Shelf Sea (a siliciclastic-dominated shelf basin in South China). These data show two cycles of expanded euxinia corresponding to the two pulses of the LOME, suggesting a strong causal relationship. Significantly, we show that intermittent or weak euxinia developed during the first extinction pulse, which likely accounts for the loss of benthic fauna and some planktonic organisms and nektonic groups. By contrast, the development of more intense euxinia throughout the water column during the second pulse likely drove survival fauna to extinction. Superimposed upon this, significant global cooling occurred across the first extinction phase, reflecting a secondary role in driving the extinction of certain low-latitude taxa. © 2018 Geological Society of America.},

abstract={Infectious disease and climate change are considered major threats to biodiversity and act as drivers behind the global amphibian decline. This is, to a large extent, based on short-term studies that are designed to detect the immediate and strongest biodiversity responses to a threatening process. What few long-term studies are available, although typically focused on single species, report outcomes that often diverge significantly from the short-term species responses. Here, we report the results of an 18-year survey of an amphibian community exposed to both climate warming and the emergence of lethal chytridiomycosis. Our study shows that the impacts of infectious disease are ongoing but restricted to two out of nine species that form the community, despite the fact all species can become infected with the fungus. Climate warming appears to be affecting four out of the nine species, but the response of three of these is an increase in abundance. Our study supports a decreasing role of infectious disease on the community, and an increasing and currently positive effect of climate warming. We caution that if the warming trends continue, the net positive effect will turn negative as amphibian breeding habitat becomes unavailable as water bodies dry, a pattern that already may be underway. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Neanderthals lived in Eurasia alongside anatomically modern humans (AMHs) until some 40,000 years ago. The extinction of Neanderthals is attributed to either climatic change, or to the effect of competition with AMHs. We used fossil occurrence records and paleoclimatic data to model the potential distributions of H. sapiens and H. neanderthalensis using Species Distribution Models, and calculated the degree of habitat quality and connectivity at successive time steps. We found that both species potential geographic ranges progressively retreated from their northeastern borders beginning with 44 ka. Although the degree of habitat loss is similar for the two species, the potential range for H. sapiens was constantly some 50% larger on average. The degree of habitat fragmentation, and the size, number, and average distance between optimal habitat patches was initially very similar for the two species. However, all these landscape metrics showed a progressive deterioration for H. neanderthalensis only over time. At the end of their existence, the most suitable habitat patches for Neanderthals were small and isolated, and their inferred climatic niche width was statistically narrower than in H. sapiens. This does not mean that climate worsening drove Neanderthals extinct, yet it suggests extinction risk for the latter markedly increased over time, towards its actual extinction date. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In the present study, we measured spatiotemporal properties of ecological niches of amphibians in China and tested the relative importance of various niche-diversity metrics for explaining the evolutionary distinctiveness-weighted extinction risk (EDGE) of amphibian species. We applied the hierarchical partitioning technique on the phylogenetically independent contrasts of the niche covariates and EDGE of amphibians, for the purpose of removing the influence of evolutionary inertia among species. As a comparison, phylogenetic least-square general regression (PLGS) was also conducted. The results showed that EDGE was high for those amphibian species of China identified as Critically Endangered or Endangered on the IUCN Red List. Niche fragmentation dimension (NFD) and niche position (NP) were the top two predictors across partial correlation analyses, hierarchical variation partitioning, PLGS and multiple regression analyses. Most temporal niche properties were not significantly associated with the EDGE index of amphibians. Variation partitioning analysis showed that the spatial component of niche measures explained the largest proportion of total variation in EDGE (∼31%), whereas the temporal component of niche properties explained ∼8% of the variation. The significantly negative role of NFD and extinction risk of amphibians in China may be attributed to a reduced rescue effect, habitat geometry, and local extinction in species with large and continuous distributional ranges.},

abstract={Subterranean ecosystems present ideal opportunities to study mechanisms underlying responses to changes in climate because species within them are often adapted to a largely constant temperature. We have characterized the thermal conditions of caves in the western Alps, and related these hypogean climate data to the occurrence of Troglohyphantes spiders (Araneae, Linyphiidae). Our data indicated that present distributions reflect Pleistocene glaciation events and also pointed to specific responses as a consequence of changes in temperature. Constant temperatures recorded inside caves provide an approximation of the mean annual temperature outside, thus we extended the results to a regional scale. We used ecological niche modeling to predict habitat suitability both in the Pleistocene and under future global warming scenarios. These analyses pointed toward a future decline in habitat suitability for subterranean spiders and the potential extinction of the most restricted endemic species. When compared with other species that live in confined habitats such as islands and mountains, we expect cave species to be as much, if not more, vulnerable to climate change. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Climate change is affecting many freshwater species, particularly fishes. Predictions of future climate change suggest large and deleterious effects on species with narrow dispersal abilities due to limited hydrological connectivity. In turn, this creates the potential for population isolation in thermally unsuitable habitats, leading to physiological stress, species declines or possible extirpation. The current extent of many freshwater fish species’ spatio-temporal distribution patterns and their sensitivity to thermal impacts from climate change − critical information for conservation planning − are often unknown. Carmine shiner (Notropis percobromus) is an ecologically important species listed as threatened or imperilled nationally (Canada) and regionally (South Dakota, United States) due to its restricted range and sensitivity to water quality and temperature. This research aimed to determine the current distribution and spatio-temporal variability in projected suitable habitat for Carmine shiner using niche-based modeling approaches (MaxEnt, BIOCLIM, and DOMAIN models). Statistically downscaled, bias-corrected Global Circulation Models (GCMs) data was used to model the distribution of Carmine shiner in central North America for the period of 2041–2060 (2050s). Maximum mean July temperature and temperature variability were the main factors in determining Carmine shiner distribution. Patterns of projected habitat change by the 2050s suggest the spatial extent of the current distribution of Carmine shiner would shift north, with &gt; 50% of the current distribution changing with future projections based on two Representative Concentrations Pathways for CO2 emissions. Whereas the southern extent of the distribution would become unsuitable for Carmine shiner, suitable habitats are predicted to become available further north, if accessible. Importantly, the majority of habitat gains for Carmine shiner would be in areas currently inaccessible due to dispersal limitations, suggesting current populations may face an extinction debt within the next half century. These results provide evidence that Carmine shiner may be highly vulnerable to a warming climate and suggest that management actions - such as assisted migration - may be needed to mitigate impacts from climate change and ensure the long-term persistence of the species. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Identifying climatic drivers of an animal population's vital rates and locating where they operate steers conservation efforts to optimize species recovery. The population growth of endangered whooping cranes (Grus americana) hinges on juvenile recruitment. Therefore, we identify climatic drivers (solar activity [sunspots] and weather) of whooping crane recruitment throughout the species’ life cycle (breeding, migration, wintering). Our method uses a repeated cross-validated absolute shrinkage and selection operator approach to identify drivers of recruitment. We model effects of climate change on those drivers to predict whooping crane population growth given alternative scenarios of climate change and solar activity. Years with fewer sunspots indicated greater recruitment. Increased precipitation during autumn migration signified less recruitment. On the breeding grounds, fewer days below freezing during winter and more precipitation during breeding suggested less recruitment. We predicted whooping crane recruitment and population growth may fall below long-term averages during all solar cycles when atmospheric CO2 concentration increases, as expected, to 500 ppm by 2050. Species recovery during a typical solar cycle with 500 ppm may require eight times longer than conditions without climate change and the chance of population decline increases to 31%. Although this whooping crane population is growing and may appear secure, long-term threats imposed by climate change and increased solar activity may jeopardize its persistence. Weather on the breeding grounds likely affects recruitment through hydrological processes and predation risk, whereas precipitation during autumn migration may influence juvenile mortality. Mitigating threats or abating climate change should occur within ≈30 years or this wild population of whooping cranes may begin declining. Published 2017.

Species distribution models (SDMs) indicated general declines in AOO of three species by 2050 under the A1b and A2 climate change scenarios (M. cafer, M. varius, M. longicaudatus) while two species (M. sclateri and M. cf. tenuis) remained unchanged (assuming no dispersal) or increased their AOO (assuming dispersal). While temperate species such as M. varius appear to be limited by temperature maxima (preferring cooler temperatures), the subtropical species M. sclateri appears to be limited by temperature minima (preferring warmer temperatures). Evidence for declines in AOO informed the uplisting (to a higher category of threat) of the Red List status of four Myosorex species to either vulnerable or endangered as part of a separate regional International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List assessment. © 2016, Mammal Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, Białowieża, Poland.},

abstract={Background: The debate on Late Quaternary extinctions (LQE) has long been centred on the contrast between climatic and human-related explanations, with no consensus being reached. Here we propose a macroecological approach to study LQE that combines niche and demographic models to determine the ecological mechanisms behind the megafauna extinction. Question: Is the overkill hypothesis plausible and realistic when assessing the ecological mechanisms behind LQE? What is the range of population parameters for both human and now-extinct animals that is consistent with the actual extinction pattern? Features of model: Ecological niche models (ENMs) are used to assess climate impact on population viability, whereas density-dependent population models with reciprocal feedback between humans and their prey are used to simulate human hunting pressure. The feasibility of predicted extinction scenarios and explored parameter space is ordered based on a patternoriented modelling (POM) approach. We illustrate the usefulness of our framework using the extinct South American ground sloth Megatherium as an example. Methods: We built ENMs by using fossil occurrences records and palaeoclimatic simulations from the last glacial cycle and projected their predictions to the Holocene. Population modelling was based on 4000 random samples of ENM ensembles, from which prey density was estimated using a Gaussian central-peripheral abundance model. For each ensemble, a plausible range of demographic parameters (e.g. growth rate, carrying capacity, mortality of human population, meat consumption) was set across 100 random repetitions, giving 400,000 models simulating Megatherium's extinction dynamics. Results: The macroecological approach highlighted many plausible mechanistic extinction scenarios capable of reproducing a wide range of hypotheses about the LQE. Most models (51%) simulating a vigorous human population with unrealistic growth rates (rh &gt; 1.3% per year) and intense over-exploitation of prey (individual meat-consumption-rate - CI &gt; 100 g per day from one prey only) produced scenarios of rapid extinction as predicted by the overkill hypothesis. However, such overkill scenarios unrealistically predicted earlier extinction times than that observed for Megatherium. Moreover, the high human population growth required to simulate overkill scenarios was attained only recently after the industrial revolution, specifically in the mid-1900s, and it is therefore not applicable for Pleistocene hunter-gatherers. Conversely, although less frequent across simulations, models that correctly predicted the observed extinction time (16%) revealed plausible and empirically acceptable demographic parameters, encompassing low growth rates (rh &lt; 0.70%) and mortality for the human population (mo &lt; 0.60%), combined with moderate values of individual meat consumption (CI &gt; 70 g) and geographical range collapse in Megatherium, which is produced by climate change. Conclusions: These findings, based on POM reasoning, highlight that unique mechanisms such as the overkill explanation for LQE, although feasible from model simulations, only occur with implausible parameter combinations and predict unrealistic extinction dynamics. © 2017 Matheus S.

abstract={Aims Sea-level rise is one of the most certain consequences of global warming and is predicted to exert significant adverse effects on wildlife in coastal habitats worldwide. Terrestrial fauna inhabiting low-lying islands are likely to suffer the greatest loss to habitat from sea-level rise and other oceanographic impacts stemming from anthropogenic climate change. Bramble Cay (Maizab Kaur), an ∼4ha, low elevation sand cay located in Torres Strait, Australia, supports the only known population of the endangered Bramble Cay melomys Melomys rubicola Thomas, 1924. As a result of a decline in this population noted during previous monitoring to 2004, habitat loss due to erosion of the cay and direct mortality from storm surges were implicated as major threats to this species. This study aimed to confirm the current conservation status of the species, to seek information about the key factor or factors responsible for the population decline and to recover any remaining individuals for a captive insurance population. Methods During three survey periods (December 2011, March 2014 and August-September 2014), a total of 1170 small mammal trap-nights, 60 camera trap-nights, 5h of nocturnal searches and 5h of diurnal searches were undertaken on Bramble Cay. Key results All three survey periods failed to detect any Bramble Cay melomys. The island had experienced a recent, severe reduction in vegetation, which is the primary food resource for the Bramble Cay melomys. Herbaceous cover on the cay decreased from 2.16ha in 2004 to 0.065ha in March 2014 before recovering somewhat to 0.19ha in August-September 2014. Conclusions These results demonstrate that this rodent species has now been extirpated on Bramble Cay. The vegetation decline was probably due to ocean inundation resulting from an increased frequency and intensity of weather events producing extreme high water levels and storm surges, in turn caused by anthropogenic climate change. Implications The loss of the Bramble Cay melomys from Bramble Cay probably represents the first documented mammalian extinction due to human-induced climate change. This event highlights the immediate need to mitigate predicted impacts of sea-level rise and ocean inundation on other vulnerable species occurring on low lying islands and in susceptible coastal zones through captive breeding and reintroduction or other targeted measures. © 2017 CSIRO.},

abstract={Impacts of climate change on individual species are increasingly well documented, but we lack understanding of how these effects propagate through ecological communities. Here we combine species distribution models with ecological network analyses to test potential impacts of climate change on >700 plant and animal species in pollination and seed-dispersal networks from central Europe. We discover that animal species that interact with a low diversity of plant species have narrow climatic niches and are most vulnerable to climate change. In contrast, biotic specialization of plants is not related to climatic niche breadth and vulnerability. A simulation model incorporating different scenarios of species coextinction and capacities for partner switches shows that projected plant extinctions under climate change are more likely to trigger animal coextinctions than vice versa. This result demonstrates that impacts of climate change on biodiversity can be amplified via extinction cascades from plants to animals in ecological networks. © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={The effect of twenty-first-century climate change on biodiversity is commonly forecast based on modelled shifts in species ranges, linked to habitat suitability. These projections have been coupled with species-area relationships (SAR) to infer extinction rates indirectly as a result of the loss of climatically suitable areas and associated habitat. This approach does not model population dynamics explicitly, and so accepts that extinctions might occur after substantial (but unknown) delays-an extinction debt. Here we explicitly couple bioclimatic envelopemodels of climate and habitat suitability with generic life-history models for 24 species of frogs found in the Australian Wet Tropics (AWT).We showthat (i) as many as four species of frogs face imminent extinction by 2080, due primarily to climate change; (ii) three frogs face delayed extinctions; and (iii) this extinction debt will take at least a century to be realized in full. Furthermore, we find congruence between forecast rates of extinction using SARs, and demographic models with an extinction lag of 120 years. We conclude that SAR approaches can provide useful advice to conservation on climate change impacts, provided there is a good understanding of the time lags over which delayed extinctions are likely to occur. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.},

abstract={Chemical contamination is often suggested as an important contributing factor to amphibian population declines, but direct links are rarely reported. Population modeling provides a quantitative method to integrate toxicity data with demographic data to understand the long-term effects of contaminants on population persistence. In this study we use laboratory-derived embryo and larval toxicity data for two anuran species to investigate the potential for toxicity to contribute to population declines. We use the southern toad (Anaxyrus terrestris) and the southern leopard frog (Lithobates sphenocephalus) as model species to investigate copper (Cu) toxicity. We use matrix models to project populations through time and quantify extinction risk (the probability of quasi-extinction in 35 yr). Life-history parameters for toads and frogs were obtained from previously published literature or unpublished data from a long-term (>35 yr) data set. In addition to Cu toxicity, we investigate the role of climate change on amphibian populations by including the probability of early pond drying that results in catastrophic reproductive failure (CRF, i.e., complete mortality of all larval individuals). Our models indicate that CRF is an important parameter for both species as both were unable to persist when CRF probability was >50% for toads or 40% for frogs. Copper toxicity alone did not result in significant effects on extinction risk unless toxicity was very high (>50% reduction in survival parameters). For toads, Cu toxicity and high probability of CRF both resulted in high extinction risk but no synergistic (or greater than additive) effects between the two stressors occurred. For leopard frogs, in the absence of CRF survival was high even under Cu toxicity, but with CRF Cu toxicity increased extinction risk. Our analyses highlight the importance of considering multiple stressors as well as species differences in response to those stressors. Our models were consistently most sensitive to juvenile and adult survival, further suggesting the importance of terrestrial stages to population persistence. Future models will incorporate multiple wetlands with different combinations of stressors to understand if our results for a single wetland result in a population sink within the landscape. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={For problems like global climate change that may involve global extinction, we must not just focus, as most economic analysts do, on the trading-off of current consumption (current mitigation investment reduces consumption) against future consumption (less need for future investment), but also consider the effects of mitigation investment in reducing the extinction probabilities. Future utility/welfare values should only be discounted at the uncertainty of their realization, making these values even in the far future important as this discount rate should be very low (0.01 per cent per annum or less). Immediate and strong actions of environmental protection including greenhouse gas reduction may thus be justified despite high consumption discount rates (about 5 per cent). Unexpectedly, an increase in the extinction probabilities may increase or decrease our willingness to reduce them; precise conditions are given. The related intuition that, the higher the probability of destruction of your house by fire, the less willing you will be in investing on things like interior decoration that does not change the probability of destruction, but the higher your willingness to pave a fire clearance that does reduce the probability of destruction, is examined. © 2016 University of Durham and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},

abstract={Mass extinctions disrupt ecological communities. Although climate changes produce stress in ecological communities, few paleobiological studies have systematically addressed the impact of global climate changes on the fine details of community structure with a view to understanding how changes in community structure presage, or even cause, biodiversity decline during mass extinctions. Based on a novel Bayesian approach to biotope assessment, we present a study of changes in species abundance distribution patterns of macroplanktonic graptolite faunas (∼447-444 Ma) leading into the Late Ordovician mass extinction. Communities at two contrasting sites exhibit significant decreases in complexity and evenness as a consequence of the preferential decline in abundance of dysaerobic zone specialist species. The observed changes in community complexity and evenness commenced well before the dramatic population depletions that mark the tipping point of the extinction event. Initially, community changes tracked changes in the oceanic water masses, but these relations broke down during the onset of mass extinction. Environmental isotope and biomarker data suggest that sea surface temperature and nutrient cycling in the paleotropical oceans changed sharply during the latest Katian time, with consequent changes in the extent of the oxygen minimum zone and phytoplankton community composition. Although many impacted species persisted in ephemeral populations, increased extinction risk selectively depleted the diversity of paleotropical graptolite species during the latest Katian and early Hirnantian. The effects of long- Term climate change on habitats can thus degrade populations in ways that cascade through communities, with effects that culminate in mass extinction.},

abstract={The mass extinction of life 66 million years ago at the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary, marked by the extinctions of dinosaurs and shallow marine organisms, is important because it led to the macroevolution of mammals and appearance of humans. The current hypothesis for the extinction is that an asteroid impact in present-day Mexico formed condensed aerosols in the stratosphere, which caused the cessation of photosynthesis and global near-freezing conditions. Here, we show that the stratospheric aerosols did not induce darkness that resulted in milder cooling than previously thought. We propose a new hypothesis that latitude-dependent climate changes caused by massive stratospheric soot explain the known mortality and survival on land and in oceans at the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary. The stratospheric soot was ejected from the oil-rich area by the asteroid impact and was spread globally. The soot aerosols caused sufficiently colder climates at mid-high latitudes and drought with milder cooling at low latitudes on land, in addition to causing limited cessation of photosynthesis in global oceans within a few months to two years after the impact, followed by surface-water cooling in global oceans in a few years. The rapid climate change induced terrestrial extinctions followed by marine extinctions over several years.},

We document a 7.8±3.3 °C warming synchronous with the onset of Deccan Traps volcanism and a second, smaller warming at the time of meteorite impact. Local warming may have been amplified due to simultaneous disappearance of continental or sea ice.

abstract={De-extinction is becoming potentially feasible for restoring extinct species in the wild, but research is required to determine the likelihood of success in light of contemporary and future environmental change. We assessed 1900-2100 change in suitable climate and land cover in the historic range of Carolina parakeet (Conuropsis carolinensis), ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis) and passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius), in North America. Parakeet and woodpecker historic range currently remains climatically-favourable, but intensified land use has broadly reduced habitat in contemporary landscapes. For passenger pigeon, more substantive loss in climate and land cover suitability exists in both the historic full range and primary breeding range. Long-term climate and land cover projections suggest that improved habitat suitability and increased potential future distribution outside historic ranges are likely for each de-extinction candidate. While such changes could improve probability of success for de-extinction programs, extensive mismatch between historic and future habitat suitability highlights the potential risks of reviving species that may colonize novel geographic space. To date, potential long-term negative effects of de-extinction programs to ecosystems outside historic ranges have not been elucidated, making this a priority concern for any serious proposal. To address whether benefits of reinstating extinct species to historic ecosystems outweigh risks to extant species outside their historic range will require extensive ecological, social and economic analyses that extend beyond that conducted to-date for this potentially transformational conservation tool. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Global climate change is impacting the distribution and abundance of species acting as a major cause of species extinction. It is rapid in freshwater swamp forest ecosystems, since they support disproportionate levels of biodiversity compared to their spatial coverage. The natural swamp forests of Bangladesh have been especially susceptible to climate change as they are limited in range to a few scattered patches in the north-eastern region. We sought to understand how climate change may impact the swamp forests of Bangladesh by modelling distributional changes in Pongamia pinnata and Barringtonia acutangula species, which dominate or co-dominate most swamp forest ecosystems across Bangladesh. We used the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modelling tool, combined presence-only data of species and bioclimatic variables for two climate scenarios (RCP6.0 and RCP8.5). We compared current, 2050 and 2070 distributions. Results suggest that plant extractable water holding capacity of soil, annual precipitation, precipitation of warmest quarter and mean annual actual evapotranspiration are the key bioclimatic variables for the distribution of both trees. The MaxEnt models indicate that Pongamia pinnata and Barringtonia acutangula trees of Bangladesh face increasing climate stress and may become extinction under both mid-range and extreme climate scenarios. © 2016, Society of Wetland Scientists.},

abstract={Climate change poses a severe global threat to freshwater ecosystems. Aestivating freshwater fauna (i.e., those that undergo periods of dominancy during dry periods) are likely to be highly susceptible to climate change due to their unique life-cycles, although empirical data that demonstrates this are lacking. This study utilised two aestivating fishes as model species, the salamanderfish, Lepidogalaxias salamandroides, and the black-stripe minnow, Galaxiella nigrostriata; both of which are endemic to Australia's Southwestern Province, an area undergoing a severe drying trend that global climate models project will continue. We found that the distributions of both species have undergone large reductions in extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO), coinciding with an extensive period of severe drying of the region. L. salamandroides was more likely to be found in deeper pools, while G. nigrostriata was found more often in pools with greater connectivity, and the probability of occurrence of both species was significantly associated with lower water temperature and pH, and higher oxidation-reduction potential. The majority of those factors are strongly influenced by the local climate, as stable isotope analyses found the hydrology of the pools in which they occurred was influenced by winter rainfall, either through direct input and/or expression from a superficial aquifer. This suggests that increasing water temperature and declining rainfall, features of the climatic shift in south-western Australia over the last 40. years, have been the major drivers of the observed declines in range. Given that climate models project both continued rainfall reductions within the species' distributional ranges and water table decreases by up to 4. m by 2030, further population losses are expected. Moreover, a review of the distribution of aestivating fish species throughout the world revealed that 75% are found in regions projected to dry due to climate change. This has considerable management implications, and active intervention, such as the protection of their existing environments and the creation of new suitable habitats, is required to prevent species declines. Fortunately, at least for the two aestivating species found in Western Australia, artificial ponds are utilised and therefore the construction of new waterbodies could help halt their decline, although further research is required to develop the optimal design for species persistence. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Late Quaternary megafauna extinctions impoverished mammalian diversity worldwide. The causes of these extinctions in Australia are most controversial but essential to resolve, because this continent-wide event presaged similar losses that occurred thousands of years later on other continents. Here we apply a rigorous metadata analysis and new ensemble-hindcasting approach to 659 Australian megafauna fossil ages. When coupled with analysis of several high-resolution climate records, we show that megafaunal extinctions were broadly synchronous among genera and independent of climate aridity and variability in Australia over the last 120,000 years. Our results reject climate change as the primary driver of megafauna extinctions in the world's most controversial context, and instead estimate that the megafauna disappeared Australia-wide ∼13,500 years after human arrival, with shorter periods of coexistence in some regions. This is the first comprehensive approach to incorporate uncertainty in fossil ages, extinction timing and climatology, to quantify mechanisms of prehistorical extinctions. © 2016, NPG.

abstract={Evidence has accumulated in recent decades on the drastic impact of climate change on biodiversity. Warming temperatures have induced changes in species physiology, phenology, and have decreased body size. Such modifications can impact population dynamics and could lead to changes in life cycle and demography. More specifically, conceptual frameworks predict that global warming will severely threaten tropical ectotherms while temperate ectotherms should resist or even benefit from higher temperatures. However, experimental studies measuring the impacts of future warming trends on temperate ectotherms' life cycle and population persistence are lacking. Here we investigate the impacts of future climates on a model vertebrate ectotherm species using a large-scale warming experiment. We manipulated climatic conditions in 18 seminatural populations over two years to obtain a present climate treatment and a warm climate treatment matching IPCC predictions for future climate. Warmer temperatures caused a faster body growth, an earlier reproductive onset, and an increased voltinism, leading to a highly accelerated life cycle but also to a decrease in adult survival. A matrix population model predicts that warm climate populations in our experiment should go extinct in around 20 y. Comparing our experimental climatic conditions to conditions encountered by populations across Europe, we suggest that warming climates should threaten a significant number of populations at the southern range of the distribution. Our findings stress the importance of experimental approaches on the entire life cycle to more accurately predict population and species persistence in future climates. © 2015 Bestion et al.},

abstract={Species depending on specific biotic interactions are particularly threatened by environmental changes. Therefore, host dependency in species living in parasitic relationships is acknowledged as a crucial factor increasing climatic susceptibility and species decline. In Maculinea butterflies and Myrmica ants, a complex form of social parasitism brings the butterflies into dependency of some few associated ant species for reproductive success. We evaluated to what extent these relations can be attributed to similarity in their climatic niches and whether alterations in niche overlap might foster the climatic susceptibility in Maculinea butterflies under future climate change. We show that the niches of ants and butterflies differ significantly more than expected at random corresponding to the observed flexibility in host exploitation. Moreover, a generally low degree of niche overlap and similar niche overlap scores between main and secondary host associations argue for a low host specificity of Maculinea butterflies. Pronounced range shifts and habitat retractions in all species will result in severe spatial limitations of Maculinea species by the presence of their hosts. No tightening in any of the host-parasite associations was detected under the pressure of range restrictions. Niche overlap scores remain comparably low in future scenarios and call for the possibility of extensive host shifts between all related species. Therefore, the absence of niche constraints might enable the parasites to extensively shift among hosts to allow the co-occurrence of several Maculinea species, in principle using the same host, and to maintain viable populations under the pressure of limited distributions and changing environments. © 2015, Gesellschaft für Biologische Systematik.},

abstract={A higher risk of future range losses as a result of climate change is expected to be one of the main drivers of extinction trends in vascular plants occurring in habitat types of high conservation value. Nevertheless, the impact of the climate changes of the last 60 years on the current distribution and extinction patterns of plants is still largely unclear. We applied species distribution models to study the impact of environmental variables (climate, soil conditions, land cover, topography), on the current distribution of 18 vascular plant species characteristic of three threatened habitat types in southern Germany: (i) xero-thermophilous vegetation, (ii) mesophilous mountain grasslands (mountain hay meadows and matgrass communities), and (iii) wetland habitats (bogs, fens, and wet meadows). Climate and soil variables were the most important variables affecting plant distributions at a spatial level of 10 × 10 km. Extinction trends in our study area revealed that plant species which occur in wetland habitats faced higher extinction risks than those in xero-thermophilous vegetation, with the risk for species in mesophilous mountain grasslands being intermediary. For three plant species characteristic either of mesophilous mountain grasslands or wetland habitats we showed exemplarily that extinctions from 1950 to the present day have occurred at the edge of the species' current climatic niche, indicating that climate change has likely been the main driver of extinction. This is largely consistent with current extinction trends reported in other studies. Our study indicates that the analysis of past extinctions is an appropriate means to assess the impact of climate change on species and that vulnerability to climate change is both species- and habitat-specific. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract={Numerous species have been pushed into extinction as an increasing portion of Earth's land surface has been appropriated for human enterprise. In the future, global biodiversity will be affected by both climate change and land-use change, the latter of which is currently the primary driver of species extinctions. How societies address climate change will critically affect biodiversity because climate-change mitigation policies will reduce direct climate-change impacts; however, these policies will influence land-use decisions, which could have negative impacts on habitat for a substantial number of species. We assessed the potential impact future climate policy could have on the loss of habitable area in biodiversity hotspots due to associated land-use changes. We estimated past extinctions from historical land-use changes (1500-2005) based on the global gridded land-use data used for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report and habitat extent and species data for each hotspot. We then estimated potential extinctions due to future land-use changes under alternative climate-change scenarios (2005-2100). Future land-use changes are projected to reduce natural vegetative cover by 26-58% in the hotspots. As a consequence, the number of additional species extinctions, relative to those already incurred between 1500 and 2005, due to land-use change by 2100 across all hotspots ranged from about 220 to 21000 (0.2% to 16%), depending on the climate-change mitigation scenario and biological factors such as the slope of the species-area relationship and the contribution of wood harvest to extinctions. These estimates of potential future extinctions were driven by land-use change only and likely would have been higher if the direct effects of climate change had been considered. Future extinctions could potentially be reduced by incorporating habitat preservation into scenario development to reduce projected future land-use changes in hotspots or by lessening the impact of future land-use activities on biodiversity within hotspots. © 2015 Society for Conservation Biology.},

The Wuchiapingian-Changhsingian boundary is at or close to the Kembla Sandstone horizon in the Illawarra Coal Measures, southern Sydney Basin, in the middle part of the Newcastle Coal Measures in the northern Sydney Basin, and in the middle of the Black Alley Shale in the southern Bowen Basin. The end-Permian mass extinction is recognised at the base of the Coal Cliff Sandstone in the southern Sydney Basin, at the top of the Newcastle Coal Measures in the northern Sydney Basin, and close to the base of the Rewan Group in the Bowen Basin and is dated at c. 252.2 Ma. The end-Permian mass extinction is interpreted to be synchronous globally in both marine and terrestrial environments, and in high and low latitudes (resolution <. 0.5 my). The GSSP-defined Permian-Triassic boundary is interpreted to be approximately at the level of the Scarborough Sandstone in the lower Narrabeen Group, Sydney Basin, and in the lower Rewan Group, Bowen Basin. New dates presented here suggest that the P3 and P4 glacial episodes in the Permian of eastern Australia are early Roadian to early Capitanian, and late Capitanian to mid Wuchiapingian in age respectively. The greenhouse crisis in the uppermost Pebbly Beach and Rowan Formations of the Sydney Basin is interpreted as early mid Roadian, a mid-Capitanian age for the crisis at the base of the Illawarra/Whittingham Coal Measures is confirmed. Greenhouse crises in the upper Illawarra/Newcastle Coal Measures and lower Narrabeen Group of the Sydney Basin are dated as upper Changhsingian-Induan, and in the upper Narrabeen Group/lower Hawksbury Sandstone as upper Olenekian. © 2014 International Association for Gondwana Research.},

abstract={There are widespread concerns that anthropogenic climate change will become a major cause of global biodiversity loss. However, the potential impact of climate change on the extinction risk of species remains poorly understood, particularly in comparison to other current threats. The objective of this research was to examine the relative impact of climate change on extinction risk of upper montane tree species in the tropical Andes, an area of high biodiversity value that is particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts. The extinction risk of 129 tree species endemic to the region was evaluated according to the IUCN Red List criteria, both with and without the potential impacts of climate change. Evaluations were supported by development of species distribution models, using three methods (generalized additive models, recursive partitioning, and support vector machines), all of which produced similarly high AUC values when averaged across all species evaluated (0.82, 0.86, and 0.88, respectively). Inclusion of climate change increased the risk of extinction of 18-20% of the tree species evaluated, depending on the climate scenario. The relative impact of climate change was further illustrated by calculating the Red List Index, an indicator that shows changes in the overall extinction risk of sets of species over time. A 15% decline in the Red List Index was obtained when climate change was included in this evaluation. While these results suggest that climate change represents a significant threat to tree species in the tropical Andes, they contradict previous suggestions that climate change will become the most important cause of biodiversity loss in coming decades. Conservation strategies should therefore focus on addressing the multiple threatening processes currently affecting biodiversity, rather than focusing primarily on potential climate change impacts.

abstract={Synergistic effect refers to simultaneous actions of separate factors which have a greater total effect than the sum of the individual factor effects. However, there has been a limited knowledge on how synergistic effects occur and individual roles of different drivers are not often considered. Therefore, it becomes quite challenging to manage multiple threatening processes simultaneously in order to mitigate biodiversity loss. In this regard, our hypothesis is, if the traits actually play different roles in the synergistic interaction, conservation efforts could be made more effectively. To understand the synergistic effect and test our hypothesis, we examined the processes associated with the endangerment of critically endangered Chinese Crested Tern (Thalasseus bernsteini), whose total population number was estimated no more than 50. Through monitoring of breeding colonies and investigations into causative factors, combined with other data on human activities, we found that widespread human harvest of seabird eggs and increasing frequency of typhoons are the major factors that threatened the Chinese Crested Tern. Furthermore, 28 percent of breeding failures were due to the synergistic effects in which egg harvest-induced renestings suffered the higher frequent typhoons. In such combined interactions, the egg harvest has clearly served as a proximal factor for the population decline, and the superimposition of enhanced typhoon activity further accelerated the species toward imminent extinction. Our findings suggest that species endangerment, on one hand, should be treated as a synergistic process, while conservation efforts, on the other hand, should focus principally on combatting the threat that triggers synergistic effects. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={Climate change is expected to bring about profound rearrangement of ecological communities by affecting individual species distributions. The resulting communities arise from the idiosyncratic responses of species to future changes, which ultimately relate to both shrinking and expanding species ranges. While spatial patterns of colonisation and extirpation events have received great attention, the identification of specific drivers remains poorly explored. This study aims to investigate the relative contribution of species gain and loss to the turnover of fish assemblages in French rivers under future climate change, and to identify their principal drivers. Future projections of potential habitat suitability in 2080 derived from species distribution models for 40 fish species showed that colonisations and extirpations could play counterbalancing roles in the reshuffling of communities. Simultaneously, these two processes exhibited patchy spatial patterns, segregated along the longitudinal and altitudinal gradients, resulting in dramatic species turnover of ∼ 60% of the current composition of species assemblages. Beyond the effect of topographic location, colonisations were found to be driven by temperature seasonality while extirpations were affected by modifications in both thermal and precipitation regimes. These results generate the possibility of developing ecosystem-based management tools focused on the early identification of areas where particular species may be sensitive to climate changes. Disentangling the drivers of colonisation and extirpation processes provides ready-to-use information that may be easily integrated into conservation planning. This information could be used to identify potential hotspots of species gain and loss and to then compare these hotspots with newly favourable areas so as to consider their actual accessibility in order to facilitate future range shifts. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract={In the 1930s, the Canada Lynx (Lynx canadensis) was extirpated from Isle Royale, a 535-km2 island located in western Lake Superior, 22 km from the Ontario and Minnesota shorelines. The first half of the 20th century was a time of change on Isle Royale as Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) disappeared, Coyotes (Canis latrans) briefly appeared, Moose (Alces americanus), Grey wolves (Canis lupus), and Red Foxes (Vulpes vulpes) became established, and the habitat was altered by fire, logging, and over-browsing. although these changes may have contributed to the demise of the Canada Lynx, our results suggest that over-harvest was a primary cause. assuming a peak carrying capacity of 75 Canada Lynx and harvest rates comparable to those reported from 1890-1935, a population viability analysis indicated that the island population had a 0% chance of surviving 50 years. The analysis also indicated that, even in the absence of harvest, the population had only a 14% chance of persistence for 250 years. however, when 10 Canada Lynx were added to the modeled population every 10th year, the probability of persistence increased to 100%. Our analyses suggest that the island's Canada Lynx population maintained itself by periodic immigration across an ice bridge; therefore, natural recolonization should be possible. however, the probability of ice-bridge formation has declined from 0.8 in the winter of 1958-59 to 0.1 in 2012-13, likely as a result of climate change. The Isle Royale situation exemplifies another impact of climate change and the possible need to augment populations to mitigate the loss of connectivity. © 2015 The Canadian Field-Naturalist.},

abstract={Climate change is likely to become an increasingly major obstacle to slowing the rate of species extinctions. Several new assessment approaches have been proposed for identifying climate-vulnerable species, based on the assumption that established systems such as the IUCN Red List need revising or replacing because they were not developed to explicitly consider climate change. However, no assessment approach has been tested to determine its ability to provide advanced warning time for conservation action for species that might go extinct due to climate change. To test the performance of the Red List system in this capacity, we used linked niche-demographic models with habitat dynamics driven by a 'business-as-usual' climate change scenario. We generated replicate 100-year trajectories for range-restricted reptiles and amphibians endemic to the United States. For each replicate, we categorized the simulated species according to IUCN Red List criteria at annual, 5-year, and 10-year intervals (the latter representing current practice). For replicates that went extinct, we calculated warning time as the number of years the simulated species was continuously listed in a threatened category prior to extinction. To simulate data limitations, we repeated the analysis using a single criterion at a time (disregarding other listing criteria). Results show that when all criteria can be used, the Red List system would provide several decades of warning time (median = 62 years; >20 years for 99% of replicates), but suggest that conservation actions should begin as soon as a species is listed as Vulnerable, because 50% of replicates went extinct within 20 years of becoming uplisted to Critically Endangered. When only one criterion was used, warning times were substantially shorter, but more frequent assessments increased the warning time by about a decade. Overall, we found that the Red List criteria reliably provide a sensitive and precautionary way to assess extinction risk under climate change. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Aim: We analyse the taxonomic status, phylogenetic relationships, distribution and age of a newly discovered ant taxon found in the mountaintops of the island of Mallorca (Spain). We also consider the potential impact of short-term climate change on the survival of this ant and make proposals on its conservation status, risks and management. Location: Balearic Islands (Spain). Methods: We used morphological, molecular and ecological evidence to assess the specific status of the potential new species. We gathered distribution data to conduct climate-based distribution modelling of present and future occupancy under several SRES emission scenarios. Results: The existence of a new non-cryptic species of ant (Lasius balearicus Talavera, Espadaler & Vila, sp. nov.) is described from the island of Mallorca. Its distribution was found to be extremely restricted (Serra de Tramuntana) and elevationally constrained to island summits (between 800 and 1400 m a.s.l.). Molecular dating indicated that this species diverged about 1.51 million years ago from its nearest relatives, from which it can be distinguished based on several morphological traits. Ecological niche modelling shows a dramatic reduction of areas with suitable climatic conditions under the different scenarios studied. Main conclusions: Lasius balearicus represents the first endemic ant to be described in the Balearic Islands, as well as the first endemic Lasius species in the Mediterranean islands. Distribution modelling predictions, the low intraspecific genetic diversity observed, and the geographical and elevational isolation of the populations indicated a low probability for the survival of the species in the short term, thus making it a potential model to study real-time climate-based biodiversity loss. As a consequence, we strongly recommend including L. balearicus in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species under the category 'Endangered'. This case illustrates that a fraction of biodiversity remains unexplored even within Europe, arguably the best-studied region of the planet, and that the available time-window for us to study and protect it may be in some instances notably narrow. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Despite projections of biodiversity loss and proposed adaptations to climate change, few data exist on the feasibility and effectiveness of adaptation strategies in minimizing biodiversity loss. Given the urgent need for action, scientific experts can fill critical information gaps by providing rapid and discerning risk assessment. A survey of 2,329 biodiversity experts projects, on average, that 9.5% of species will become extinct due to climate change within the next 100 years. This average projection is low relative to previously published values but substantial in absolute terms, because it amounts to a loss of hundreds of thousands of species over the next century. The average projection increases to 21% when experts are asked to estimate the percentage of species that will become extinct within the next 100 years due to climate change in combination with other causes. More than three-quarters of respondents reported being uncertain about their extinction estimates. A majority of experts preferred protected areas or corridors to reduce extinction risk but identified ex situ conservation and no intervention as the most feasible strategies. Experts also suggest that managed relocation of species, a particular adaptation strategy, is justifiable and effective in some situations but not others. Justifiable circumstances include the prevention of species extinction and overcoming human-made barriers to dispersal, and while experts are divided on the potential effectiveness of managed relocation for most taxonomic groups, higher percentages predict it effective for woody plants, terrestrial insects, and mammals. Most experts are open to the potential benefits of managed relocation but are concerned about unintended harmful consequences, particularly putting non-target species at risk of extinction. On balance, published biodiversity scientists feel that managed relocation, despite controversy about it, can be part of the conservation adaptation portfolio. © 2015 Javeline et al.},

abstract={This study investigated the capacity of 50 priority species to respond to climate change. Our results indicate that many of the species in question are threatened by direct and indirect effects of climate change and have limited evolutionary and dispersal capacities to buffer detrimental effects, while plasticity may be greater. Thus, species-specific action plans are often required. Habitats that should be protected to facilitate the survival of high-risk species are in particular wetlands. In addition, many of the investigated species depend on old-growth forests with a large amount of deadwood. Because most of the 50 species studied have low dispersal capabilities, it is crucial to optimise their current habitats in order to enable them to cope in situ with further stress resulting from climate change. In particular, water regimes and microhabitat diversity need to be optimised. Depending on the species' dispersal capabilities, a network of suitable protected areas should be created at the local and/or regional scale.},

abstract={We combined novel radiocarbon dates of bat fossils with time-scaled ecological niche models (ENM) to study bat extinctions in the Caribbean. Radiocarbon-dated fossils show that late Quaternary losses of bat populations took place during the late Holocene (<4 €...ka) rather than late Pleistocene (>10 €...ka). All bat radiocarbon dates from Abaco (Bahamas) that represent extirpated populations are younger than 4 €...ka. We include data on six bat species, three of which are Caribbean endemics, and include nectarivores as well as insectivores. Climate-based ENMs from the Last Glacial Maximum to the present reflect overall stability in distributions, with suitable climatic habitat being present over time. In the absence of radiocarbon dates, bat extinctions had been presumed to take place during the last glacial-interglacial transition (ca. 10 €...ka). Now we see that extirpation of bats on these tropical islands is more complex than previously thought and primarily postdates the major climate changes that took place during the late Pleistocene-Holocene transition.},

abstract={Existing radiocarbon (14C) dates on American mastodon (Mammut americanum) fossils from eastern Beringia (Alaska and Yukon) have been interpreted as evidence they inhabited the Arctic and Subarctic during Pleistocene full-glacial times (∼18,000 14C years B.P.). However, this chronology is inconsistent with inferred habitat preferences of mastodons and correlative paleoecological evidence. To establish a last appearance date (LAD) for M. americanum regionally, we obtained 53 new 14C dates on 36 fossils, including specimens with previously published dates. Using collagen ultrafiltration and single amino acid (hydroxyproline) methods, these specimens consistently date to beyond or near the ∼50,000 y B.P. limit of 14C dating. Some erroneously "young" 14C dates are due to contamination by exogenous carbon from natural sources and conservation treatments used in museums. We suggest mastodons inhabited the high latitudes only during warm intervals, particularly the Last Interglacial [Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5] when boreal forests existed regionally. Our 14C dataset suggests that mastodons were extirpated from eastern Beringia during the MIS 4 glacial interval (∼75,000 y ago), following the ecological shift from boreal forest to steppe tundra. Mastodons thereafter became restricted to areas south of the continental ice sheets, where they suffered complete extinction ∼10,000 14C years B.P. Mastodons were already absent from eastern Beringia several tens of millennia before the first humans crossed the Bering Isthmus or the onset of climate changes during the terminal Pleistocene. Local extirpations of mastodons and other megafaunal populations in eastern Beringia were asynchrononous and independent of their final extinction south of the continental ice sheets. © 2014, National Academy of Sciences.

abstract={Predictive frameworks of climate change extinction risk generally focus on the magnitude of climate change a species is expected to experience and the potential for that species to track suitable climate. A species' risk of extinction from climate change will depend, in part, on the magnitude of climate change the species experiences, its exposure. However, exposure is only one component of risk. A species' risk of extinction will also depend on its intrinsic ability to tolerate changing climate, its sensitivity. We examine exposure and sensitivity individually for two example taxa, terrestrial amphibians and mammals. We examine how these factors are related among species and across regions and how explicit consideration of each component of risk may affect predictions of climate change impacts. We find that species' sensitivities to climate change are not congruent with their exposures. Many highly sensitive species face low exposure to climate change and many highly exposed species are relatively insensitive. Separating sensitivity from exposure reveals patterns in the causes and drivers of species' extinction risk that may not be evident solely from predictions of climate change. Our findings emphasise the importance of explicitly including sensitivity and exposure to climate change in assessments of species' extinction risk.},

abstract={Species distribution models (SDMs), especially those basing on climatic parameters, have frequently been used to project future species ranges and to develop conservation strategies. As suggested by several authors, we considered both different dispersal abilities and different evolutionarily significant units (ESUs, as determined in an earlier genetic survey). For our study species, the flightless ground beetle Carabus irregularis, SDMs for two ESUs from the western and the Carpathian area of the distribution range showed immense, and deviating future range contractions reflecting divergent ecological requirements. As minimal dispersal SDMs resulted in a stronger decline of future ranges than the maximal dispersal models, low dispersal ability tended to strengthen the already high vulnerability of the cold-adapted mountain species to global warming. Areas shown in our maximal dispersal models as offering climatically suitable habitats for C. irregularis in the future should be considered as potential areas of action in future conservation planning (e.g. assisted migration or assisted colonisation). Thus, both dispersal scenarios and different (if applicable) ESUs should be considered when developing SDMs as useful tools for species conservation strategies adapted to species’ performance and differentiation patterns. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Over the next century, the conservation of biodiversity will depend not only on our ability to understand the effect of climate change, but also on our capacity to predict how other factors interact with climate change to influence species viability. We used American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.), the United States' premier wild-harvested medicinal, as a model system to ask whether the effect of harvest on extinction risk depends on changing climatic conditions. We performed stochastic projections of viability response to an increase in maximum growing-season temperature of 18C over the next 70 years by sampling matrices from long-term demographic studies of 12 populations (representing 75 population-years of data). In simulations that included harvest and climate change, extinction risk at the median population size (N = 140) was 65%, far exceeding the additive effects of the two factors (extinction risk = 8% and 6% for harvest and climate change, respectively; quasi-extinction threshold = 20). We performed a life table response experiment (LTRE) to determine underlying causes of the effect of warming and harvest on deterministic λ (kd). Together, these factors decreased kd values primarily by reducing growth of juvenile and small adult plants to the large-adult stage, as well as decreasing stasis of the juveniles and large adults. The interaction observed in stochastic model results followed from a nonlinear increase in extinction risk as the combined impact of harvest and warming consistently reduced λ values below the demographic tipping point of λ = 1. While further research is needed to create specific recommendations, these findings indicate that ginseng harvest regulations should be revised to account for changing climate. Given the possibility of nonlinear response like that reported here, pre-emptive adaptation of management strategies may increase efficacy of biodiversity conservation by allowing behavior modification prior to precipitous population decline. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.},

This type of equation originally comes from a model in population dynamics (see [3,17,18]) to study the impact of climate change on the persistence versus extinction of species. From these works, we know that the dynamics is governed by the traveling fronts u (t, x1 , y ) = U (x1 - ct, y) , thus characterizing the set of traveling fronts plays a major role. In this paper, we first consider a more general model than the model of [3] in higher dimensional space, where the environment is only assumed to be globally unfavorable with favorable pockets extending to infinity. We consider in two frameworks: the reaction term is time-independent or time-periodic dependent. For the latter, we study the concentration of the species when the environment outside Ω becomes extremely unfavorable and further prove a symmetry breaking property of the fronts. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The late Quaternary megafauna extinction was a severe global-scale event. Two factors, climate change and modern humans, have received broad support as the primary drivers, but their absolute and relative importance remains controversial. To date, focus has been on the extinction chronology of individual or small groups of species, specific geographical regions or macroscale studies at very coarse geographical and taxonomic resolution, limiting the possibility of adequately testing the proposed hypotheses. We present, to our knowledge, the first global analysis of this extinction based on comprehensive country-level data on the geographical distribution of all large mammal species (more than or equal to 10 kg) that have gone globally or continentally extinct between the beginning of the Last Interglacial at 132 000 years BP and the late Holocene 1000 years BP, testing the relative roles played by glacial-interglacial climate change and humans. We show that the severity of extinction is strongly tied to hominin palaeobiogeography, with at most a weak, Eurasia-specific link to climate change. This first species-level macroscale analysis at relatively high geographical resolution provides strong support for modern humans as the primary driver of the worldwide megafauna losses during the late Quaternary. © 2014 The Authors Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Developing conservation strategies for threatened species increasingly requires understanding vulnerabilities to climate change, in terms of both demographic sensitivities to climatic and other environmental factors, and exposure to variability in those factors over time and space. We conducted a range-wide, spatially explicit climate change vulnerability assessment for Eastern Massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus), a declining endemic species in a region showing strong environmental change. Using active season and winter adult survival estimates derived from 17 data sets throughout the species' range, we identified demographic sensitivities to winter drought, maximum precipitation during the summer, and the proportion of the surrounding landscape dominated by agricultural and urban land cover. Each of these factors was negatively associated with active season adult survival rates in binomial generalized linear models. We then used these relationships to back-cast adult survival with dynamic climate variables from 1950 to 2008 using spatially explicit demographic models. Demographic models for 189 population locations predicted known extant and extirpated populations well (AUC = 0.75), and models based on climate and land cover variables were superior to models incorporating either of those effects independently. These results suggest that increasing frequencies and severities of extreme events, including drought and flooding, have been important drivers of the long-term spatiotemporal variation in a demographic rate. We provide evidence that this variation reflects nonadaptive sensitivity to climatic stressors, which are contributing to long-term demographic decline and range contraction for a species of high-conservation concern. Range-wide demographic modeling facilitated an understanding of spatial shifts in climatic suitability and exposure, allowing the identification of important climate refugia for a dispersal-limited species. Climate change vulnerability assessment provides a framework for linking demographic and distributional dynamics to environmental change, and can thereby provide unique information for conservation planning and management. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Context Reviews of climate change in Australia have identified that it is imposing additional stresses on biodiversity, which is already under threat from multiple human impacts. Aims The present study aimed to determine the contributions of several factors to the demise of the koala in the Eden region in south-eastern New South Wales and, in particular, to establish to what extent climate change may have exacerbated the decline. Methods The study built on several community-based koala surveys in the Eden region since 1986, verified through interviews with survey respondents. Historical records as far back as the late 19th century, wildlife databases and field-based surveys were used to independently validate the community survey data and form a reliable picture of changes in the Eden koala population. Analysis of the community survey data used a logistic model to assess the contribution of known threats to koalas, including habitat loss measured as changes in foliage projective cover, fire, increases in the human population and climate change in the form of changes in temperature and rainfall, to the regional decline of this species. Key results We found a marked, long-term shrinkage in the distribution of the koala across the Eden region. Our modelling demonstrated that a succession of multiple threats to koalas from land use (human population growth and habitat loss) and environmental change (temperature increase and drought) were significant contributors to this decline. Conclusions Climate change, particularly drought and rising temperatures, has been a hitherto hidden factor that has been a major driver of the decline of the koala in the Eden region.

abstract={Anthropogenic climate change is a key threat to global biodiversity. To inform strategic actions aimed at conserving biodiversity as climate changes, conservation planners need early warning of the risks faced by different species. The IUCN Red List criteria for threatened species are widely acknowledged as useful risk assessment tools for informing conservation under constraints imposed by limited data. However, doubts have been expressed about the ability of the criteria to detect risks imposed by potentially slow-acting threats such as climate change, particularly because criteria addressing rates of population decline are assessed over time scales as short as 10 years. We used spatially explicit stochastic population models and dynamic species distribution models projected to future climates to determine how long before extinction a species would become eligible for listing as threatened based on the IUCN Red List criteria. We focused on a short-lived frog species (Assa darlingtoni) chosen specifically to represent potential weaknesses in the criteria to allow detailed consideration of the analytical issues and to develop an approach for wider application. The criteria were more sensitive to climate change than previously anticipated; lead times between initial listing in a threatened category and predicted extinction varied from 40 to 80 years, depending on data availability. We attributed this sensitivity primarily to the ensemble properties of the criteria that assess contrasting symptoms of extinction risk. Nevertheless, we recommend the robustness of the criteria warrants further investigation across species with contrasting life histories and patterns of decline. The adequacy of these lead times for early warning depends on practicalities of environmental policy and management, bureaucratic or political inertia, and the anticipated species response times to management actions. © 2014 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={There is an urgent need to develop effective vulnerability assessments for evaluating the conservation status of species in a changing climate. Several new assessment approaches have been proposed for evaluating the vulnerability of species to climate change based on the expectation that established assessments such as the IUCN Red List need revising or superseding in light of the threat that climate change brings. However, although previous studies have identified ecological and life history attributes that characterize declining species or those listed as threatened, no study so far has undertaken a quantitative analysis of the attributes that cause species to be at high risk of extinction specifically due to climate change. We developed a simulation approach based on generic life history types to show here that extinction risk due to climate change can be predicted using a mixture of spatial and demographic variables that can be measured in the present day without the need for complex forecasting models. Most of the variables we found to be important for predicting extinction risk, including occupied area and population size, are already used in species conservation assessments, indicating that present systems may be better able to identify species vulnerable to climate change than previously thought. Therefore, although climate change brings many new conservation challenges, we find that it may not be fundamentally different from other threats in terms of assessing extinction risks. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract={Alpine grouses are particularly vulnerable to climate change due to their adaptation to extreme conditions and to their relict distributions in the Alps where global warming has been particularly marked in the last half century. Grouses are also currently threatened by habitat modification and human disturbance, and an assessment of the impact of multiple stressors is needed to predict the fate of Alpine populations of these birds in the next decades. We estimated the effect of climate change and human disturbance on a rock ptarmigan population living in the western Italian Alps by combining an empirical population modelling approach and stochastic simulations of the population dynamics under the a1B climate scenario and two different disturbance scenarios, represented by the development of a ski resort, through 2050.The early appearance of snow-free ground in the previous spring had a favorable effect on the rock ptarmigan population, probably through a higher reproductive success. On the contrary, delayed snowfall in autumn had a negative effect possibly due to a mismatch in time to molt to white winter plumage which increases predation risk. The regional climate model PROTHEUS does not foresee any significant change in snowmelt date in the study area, while the start date of continuous snow cover is expected to be significantly delayed. The net effect in the stochastic projections is a more or less pronounced (depending on the model used) decline in the studied population. The addition of extra-mortality due to collision with ski-lift wires led the population to fatal consequences in most projections. Should these results be confirmed by larger studies the conservation of Alpine populations would deserve more attention. To counterbalance the effects of climate change, the reduction of all causes of death should be pursued, through a strict preservation of the habitats in the present area of occurrence. © 2013 Imperio et al.},

abstract={Summary: Current models estimating impact of habitat loss on biodiversity in the face of global climate change usually project only percentages of species 'committed to extinction' on an uncertain time-scale. Here, we show that this limitation can be overcome using an empirically derived 'background extinction rate-area' curve to estimate natural rates and project future rates of freshwater fish extinction following variations in river drainage area resulting from global climate change. Based on future climatic projections, we quantify future active drainage basin area losses and combine them with the extinction rate-area curve to estimate the future change in extinction rate for each river basin. We then project the number of extinct species in each river basin using a global data base of freshwater fish species richness. The median projected extinction rate owing to climate change conditions is c. 7% higher than the median background extinction rate. A closer look at the pattern reveals great geographical variations highlighting an amplification of aridity by 2090 and subsequent increase in extinction rates in presently semi-arid and Mediterranean regions. Among the 10% most-impacted drainage basins, water availability loss will increase background extinction rates by 18·2 times (median value). Projected numbers of extinct species by 2090 show that only 20 river basins among the 1010 analysed would experience fish species extinctions attributable to water availability loss from climate change. Predicted numbers of extinct species for these rivers range from 1 to 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results strongly contrast with previous alarming predictions of huge surface-dependent climate change-driven extinctions for riverine fishes and other taxonomic groups. Furthermore, based on well-documented fish extinctions from Central and North American drainages over the last century, we also show that recent extinction rates are, on average, 130 times greater than our projected extinction rates from climate change. This last result implies that current anthropogenic threats generate extinction rates in rivers far greater than the ones expected from future water availability loss. We thus argue that conservation actions should be preferentially focused on reducing the impacts of present-day anthropogenic drivers of riverine fish extinctions.

abstract={Climate has played a crucial role in assigning a different kind of topography to Rajasthan and Gujarat since the Cenozoic time. Evidently, three genera, namely, Dipterocarpus Gaert. f., Hopea Roxb. and Shorea Roxb. of the Dipterocarpaceae are described from the Neogene sediments of western India (Rajasthan and Gujarat). These taxa are marked by their complete absence in the region today. The presence of Dipterocarpaceae in western India has been noticed from the Early Eocene up to the Plio-Pleistocene in deep time. The family is usually a dominant component of the humid tropical and subtropical flora of the Indo-Malayan region and its discovery, along with earlier described fossils from western India indicates existence of ancient tropical rain forests in western India. A change in the climate affected warm and humid conditions occurring there during the Cenozoic resulting in arid to semi-arid climate at present which is responsible for the ultimate extinction of Dipterocarpaceae in the region. In addition, the palaeobiogeography of Dipterocarpaceae is reviewed. © Indian Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={Ecological niche models (ENMs) are the primary tool used to describe and forecast the potential influence of climate change on biodiversity. However, ENMs do not directly account for important biological and landscape processes likely to affect range dynamics at a variety of spatial scales. Recent advances to link ENMs with population models have focused on the fundamental step of integrating dispersal and metapopulation dynamics into forecasts of species geographic ranges. Here we use a combination of novel analyses and a synthesis of findings from published plant and animal case studies to highlight three seldom recognised, yet important, advantages of linking ENMs with demographic modelling approaches: 1) they provide direct measures of extinction risk in addition to measures of vulnerability based on change in the potential range area or total habitat suitability. 2) They capture life-history traits that permit population density to vary in different ways in response to key spatial drivers, conditioned by the processes of global change. 3) They can be used to explore and rank the cost effectiveness of regional conservation alternatives and demographically oriented management interventions. Given these advantages, we argue that coupled methods should be used preferentially where data permits and when conservation management decisions require intervention, prioritization, or direct estimates of extinction risk. © 2013 The Author.

abstract={Aim: As the global climate is changing rapidly, there is a need to make conservation decisions to facilitate species' persistence under climate change. Models employed to make predictions regarding the impacts of climate change on species' distributions, and ultimately persistence, typically assume that interannual variability in environmental conditions is independent between years. However, the colour of environmental noise has been shown to affect extinction risk in populations occupying spatially static environments, and should therefore affect persistence during climate change. This study aims to investigate the importance of noise colour for extinction risk during climate-induced range shifts. Methods: We use a spatially explicit coupled map lattice with a latitudinal gradient in climatic suitability, together with time series of environmental noise, to simulate periods of directional climate change and investigate the effects of noise colour on extinction risk and range size. Results: Extinction risk increases with reddening of the environmental noise, and this effect is particularly pronounced over short time frames when climate change is rapid. Main conclusions: Given that management decisions are typically made over such short time frames, and the rapid rates of climate change currently being experienced, we highlight the importance of incorporating realistic time series of environmental noise into models used for conservation planning under climate change. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Aim: To quantify the consequences of major threats to biodiversity, such as climate and land-use change, it is important to use explicit measures of species persistence, such as extinction risk. The extinction risk of metapopulations can be approximated through simple models, providing a regional snapshot of the extinction probability of a species. We evaluated the extinction risk of three species under different climate change scenarios in three different regions of the Mexican cloud forest, a highly fragmented habitat that is particularly vulnerable to climate change. Location: Cloud forests in Mexico. Methods: Using Maxent, we estimated the potential distribution of cloud forest for three different time horizons (2030, 2050 and 2080) and their overlap with protected areas. Then, we calculated the extinction risk of three contrasting vertebrate species for two scenarios: (1) climate change only (all suitable areas of cloud forest through time) and (2) climate and land-use change (only suitable areas within a currently protected area), using an explicit patch-occupancy approximation model and calculating the joint probability of all populations becoming extinct when the number of remaining patches was less than five. Results: Our results show that the extent of environmentally suitable areas for cloud forest in Mexico will sharply decline in the next 70 years. We discovered that if all habitat outside protected areas is transformed, then only species with small area requirements are likely to persist. With habitat loss through climate change only, high dispersal rates are sufficient for persistence, but this requires protection of all remaining cloud forest areas. Main conclusions: Even if high dispersal rates mitigate the extinction risk of species due to climate change, the synergistic impacts of changing climate and land use further threaten the persistence of species with higher area requirements. Our approach for assessing the impacts of threats on biodiversity is particularly useful when there is little time or data for detailed population viability analyses. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Plastic responses of species to unprecedented conditions and increased variability caused by climate change (CC) and anthropogenic disturbances are expected to play a major role determining populations' extinction risk. We developed a method for assessing CC effects on population dynamics based on analyzing plastic life history responses to weather conditions within an ensemble forecasting framework. The method is illustrated using two threatened cactus species with contrasting distribution ranges. Demographic models were parameterized using 5. years of field data, from which the relationship between life-history traits and rainfall and temperature was estimated. These functions were used in Integral Projection Models to predict population growth under CC scenarios and different anthropogenic disturbance regimes. Both species were affected by CC and its interaction with disturbance. The most widespread species was less affected by CC, suggesting that past selection on plasticity allows it to survive under variable conditions. Managing disturbance appropriately lessened the impact of CC. Some directives for conservation under CC were identified based on projected elasticity values. Our procedure for modeling population dynamics as a function of climate may be used for designing management plans for conservation or sustainable use aimed at important plant sizes or life-history traits, predicting potential distributions, and identifying viable populations. © 2012 Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics.},

Here, we use a hybrid model that combines such projections with simulations of demography and seed dispersal to forecast the climate-driven spatio-temporal dynamics of 150 high-mountain plant species across the European Alps. This model predicts average range size reductions of 44ĝ€"50% by the end of the twenty-first century, which is similar to projections from the most ĝ€ optimisticĝ static model (49%). However, the hybrid model also indicates that population dynamics will lag behind climatic trends and that an average of 40% of the range still occupied at the end of the twenty-first century will have become climatically unsuitable for the respective species, creating an extinction debt. Alarmingly, species endemic to the Alps seem to face the highest range losses. These results caution against optimistic conclusions from moderate range size reductions observed during the twenty-first century as they are likely to belie more severe longer-term effects of climate warming on mountain plants. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

A fossil, Halobates ruffoi Andersen et al., 1994, described from Middle-Upper Eocene (45 Ma) Italy indicates that sea skaters were present in this part of the world in the past. Other geological evidence points to dramatic changes in the Mediterranean Sea during the Tertiary and Quaternary that may have led to their later extinction.

abstract={Most climate change predictions omit species interactions and interspecific variation in dispersal. Here, we develop a model of multiple competing species along awarming climatic gradient that includes temperaturedependent competition, differences in niche breadth and interspecific differences in dispersal ability. Competition and dispersal differences decreased diversity and produced so-called 'no-analogue' communities, defined as a novel combination of species that does not currently co-occur. Climate change altered community richness the most when species had narrow niches, when mean community-wide dispersal rates were low and when species differed in dispersal abilities. With high interspecific dispersal variance, the best dispersers tracked climate change, out-competed slower dispersers and caused their extinction. Overall, competition slowed the advance of colonists into newly suitable habitats, creating lags in climate tracking. We predict that climate change will most threaten communities of species that have narrow niches (e.g. tropics), vary in dispersal (most communities) and compete strongly. Current forecasts probably underestimate climate change impacts on biodiversity by neglecting competition and dispersal differences. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

abstract={The destructiveness of major (Category 3 to 5) hurricanes along the United States Atlantic Ocean seaboard has been recognized for centuries. While the effects of hurricanes on coastal ecosystems are well known, the influence of hurricanes on pelagic seabirds is difficult to assess. During the annual Atlantic hurricane season (~1 June to 30 November), the endangered black-capped petrel Pterodroma hasitata aggregates in Gulf Stream habitats from Florida to North Carolina. On at least 8 occasions over the past century, hurricanes have driven petrels far inland (sometimes as far as the Great Lakes), suggesting the demise of 10s to 100s of individuals. This paper models >100 yr of data to characterize and compare key aspects of hurricanes that did and did not drive petrels inland. Our model suggests that the predicted increase in the frequency of Category 3 to 5 hurricanes in the region due to climate change could nearly double the expected number of wrecked petrels over the next century and place an endangered species at greater risk of extinction. © Inter-Research 2012.},

abstract={Selectivity patterns provide insights into the causes of ancient extinction events. The Late Ordovician mass extinction was related to Gondwanan glaciation; however, it is still unclear whether elevated extinction rates were attributable to record failure, habitat loss, or climatic cooling. We examined Middle Ordovician-Early Silurian North American fossil occurrences within a spatiotemporally explicit stratigraphic framework that allowed us to quantify rock record effects on a per-taxon basis and assay the interplay of macrostratigraphic and macroecological variables in determining extinction risk. Genera that had large proportions of their observed geographic ranges affected by stratigraphic truncation or environmental shifts at the end of the Katian stage were particularly hard hit. The duration of the subsequent sampling gaps had little effect on extinction risk, suggesting that this extinction pulse cannot be entirely attributed to rock record failure; rather, it was caused, in part, by habitat loss. Extinction risk at this time was also strongly influenced by the maximum paleolatitude at which a genus had previously been sampled, a macroecological trait linked to thermal tolerance. A model trained on the relationship between 16 explanatory variables and extinction patterns during the early Katian interval substantially underestimates the extinction of exclusively tropical taxa during the late Katian interval. These results indicate that glacioeustatic sea-level fall and tropical ocean cooling played important roles in the first pulse of the Late Ordovician mass extinction in Laurentia.},

abstract={Anthropogenic global climate change has already led to alterations in biodiversity patterns by directly and indirectly affecting species distributions. It has been suggested that poikilothermic animals, including reptiles, will be particularly affected by global change and large-scale reptile declines have already been observed. Currently, half of the world's freshwater turtles and tortoises are considered threatened with extinction, and climate change may exacerbate these declines. In this study, we assess how global chelonian species richness will change in the near future. We use species distribution models developed under current climate conditions for 78% of all extant species and project them onto different Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios for 2080. We detect a strong dependence of temperature shaping most species ranges, which coincide with their general temperature-related physiological traits (i.e., temperature-dependent sex determination). Furthermore, the extent and distribution of the current bioclimatic niches of most chelonians may change remarkably in the near future, likely leading to a substantial decrease of local species abundance and ultimately a reduction in species richness. Future climatic changes may cause the ranges of 86% of the species to contract, and of these ranges, nearly 12% are predicted to be situated completely outside their currently realized niches. Hence, the interplay of increasing habitat fragmentation and loss due to climatic stress may result in a serious threat for several chelonian species. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Models that couple habitat suitability with demographic processes offer a potentially improved approach for estimating spatial distributional shifts and extinction risk under climate change. Applying such an approach to five species of Australian plants with contrasting demographic traits, we show that: (i) predicted climate-driven changes in range area are sensitive to the underlying habitat model, regardless of whether demographic traits and their interaction with habitat patch configuration are modeled explicitly; and (ii) caution should be exercised when using predicted changes in total habitat suitability or geographic extent to infer extinction risk, because the relationship between these metrics is often weak. Measures of extinction risk, which quantify threats to population persistence, are particularly sensitive to life-history traits, such as recruitment response to fire, which explained approximately 60% of the deviance in expected minimum abundance. Dispersal dynamics and habitat patch structure have the strongest influence on the amount of movement of the trailing and leading edge of the range margin, explaining roughly 40% of modeled structural deviance. These results underscore the need to consider direct measures of extinction risk (population declines and other measures of stochastic viability), as well as measures of change in habitat area, when assessing climate change impacts on biodiversity. Furthermore, direct estimation of extinction risk incorporates important demographic and ecosystem processes, which potentially influence species' vulnerability to extinction due to climate change. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Aim In central Australia, the giant flightless bird Genyornis newtoni disappeared about 45-50 thousand years ago (ka). It has been reported that coincident with this extinction the carbon isotopic composition of preserved eggshells of the extant emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) shows an abrupt dietary shift from tropical grasses (C 4 photosynthesis) to temperate grasses and/or woody browse (C 3 photosynthesis). This abrupt shift has been interpreted as signalling 'ecosystem collapse' due to landscape burning by humans. We evaluate an alternative interpretation, that the shift in diet was not abrupt, but gradual, and caused by the weakening of the Australian monsoon. Location Lake Eyre, central Australia. Methods We re-analysed a large, published dataset of emu diet δ 13C (inferred from δ 13C of preserved eggshells) spanning the last 140,000 years, using time-series analysis. Using Akaike's information criterion, we compared two contrasting models: (1) there was an abrupt shift in δ 13C coincident with the extinction of Genyornis, assumed 47.5ka; and (2) there was a gradual shift in δ 13C, correlated with reconstructed water level in Lake Eyre, a proxy for monsoon intensity. Results There was little evidence of an abrupt shift in emu diet δ 13C about 45-50ka, but δ 13C appeared to steadily decrease between about 80 and 30ka. Indeed, the model representing a correlation between δ 13C and lake level was more than seven times more likely than the model representing an abrupt shift at 47.5ka. Main conclusions The emu eggshell isotopic record from Lake Eyre does not support the hypothesis that landscape burning by humans transformed a savanna-grassland mosaic into the modern desert scrub, contributing to the extinction of Genyornis. While our findings cast strong doubt on the foremost line of evidence that landscape burning by humans caused the megafaunal extinctions, and suggest that central Australia was becoming increasingly arid in the Late Pleistocene, the relative roles of hunting by humans and climate change in the megafaunal extinctions remain unresolved. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Shell calcification in argonauts is unique. Only females of these cephalopods construct the paper nautilus shell, which is used as a brood chamber for developing embryos in the pelagic realm. As one of the thinnest (225 m) known adult mollusc shells, and lacking an outer protective periostracum-like cover, this shell may be susceptible to dissolution as the ocean warms and decreases in pH. Vulnerability of the A. nodosa shell was investigated through immersion of shell fragments in multifactorial experiments of control (19 °C/pH 8.1; pCO2 419; ΩCa = 4.23) and near-future conditions (24 °C/pH 7.8-7.6; pCO2 932-1525; ΩCa = 2.72-1.55) for 14 days. More extreme pH treatments (pH 7.4-7.2; pCO2 2454-3882; ΩCa = 1.20- 0.67) were used to assess tipping points in shell dissolution. X-ray diffractometry revealed no change in mineralogy between untreated and treated shells. Reduced shell weight due to dissolution was evident in shells incubated at pH 7.8 (projected for 2070) after 14 days at control temperature, with increased dissolution in warmer and lower pH treatments. The greatest dissolution was recorded at 24 °C (projected for local waters by 2100) compared to control temperature across all low-pH treatments. Scanning electron microscopy revealed dissolution and etching of shell mineral in experimental treatments. In the absence of compensatory mineralization, the uncovered female brood chamber will be susceptible to dissolution as ocean pH decreases. Since the shell was a crucial adaptation for the evolution of the argonauts' holopelagic existence, persistence of A. nodosa may be compromised by shell dissolution in an ocean-change world. © 2012 Marine Biological Laboratory.},

abstract={Species are influenced by multiple environmental stressors acting simultaneously. Our objective was to compare the expected effects of climate change and invasion of non-indigenous rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) on cisco (Coregonus artedii) population extirpations at a regional level. We assembled a database of over 13,000 lakes in Wisconsin, USA, summarising fish occurrence, lake morphology, water chemistry, and climate. We used A1, A2, and B1 scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of future temperature conditions for 15 general circulation models in 2046-2065 and 2081-2100 totalling 78 projections. Logistic regression indicated that cisco tended to occur in cooler, larger, and deeper lakes. Depending upon the amount of warming, 25-70% of cisco populations are predicted to be extirpated by 2100. In addition, cisco are influenced by the invasion of rainbow smelt, which prey on young cisco. Projecting current estimates of rainbow smelt spread and impact into the future will result in the extirpation of about 1% of cisco populations by 2100 in Wisconsin. Overall, the effect of climate change is expected to overshadow that of species invasion as a driver of coldwater fish population extirpations. Our results highlight the potentially dominant role of climate change as a driver of biotic change.},

abstract={Predicted effects of climate change include high extinction risk for many species, but confidence in these predictions is undermined by a perceived lack of empirical support. Many studies have now documented ecological responses to recent climate change, providing the opportunity to test whether the magnitude and nature of recent responses match predictions. Here, we perform a global and multitaxon metaanalysis to show that empirical evidence for the realized effects of climate change supports predictions of future extinction risk.We use International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List criteria as a common scale to estimate extinction risks from a wide range of climate impacts, ecological responses, and methods of analysis, and we compare predictions with observations. Mean extinction probability across studies making predictions of the future effects of climate change was 7% by 2100 compared with 15% based on observed responses. After taking account of possible bias in the type of climate change impact analyzed and the parts of the world and taxa studied, there was less discrepancy between the two approaches: predictions suggested a mean extinction probability of 10% across taxa and regions, whereas empirical evidence gave a mean probability of 14%. As well as mean overall extinction probability, observations also supported predictions in terms of variability in extinction risk and the relative risk associated with broad taxonomic groups and geographic regions. These results suggest that predictions are robust to methodological assumptions and provide strong empirical support for the assertion that anthropogenic climate change is now a major threat to global biodiversity.},

abstract={This study proposes an ecological mechanism for the terminal Pleistocene population collapse and subsequent extinction of North American megafauna. Observations of modern ecosystems indicate that feedback mechanisms between plant nutrient content, nitrogen cycling, and herbivore-plant interactions can vary between a nutrient accelerating mode favoring increased herbivore biomass and a nutrient decelerating mode characterized by reduced herbivore biomass. These alternate modes are determined largely by plant nitrogen content. Plant nitrogen content is known to be influenced by atmospheric CO2 concentrations, temperature, and precipitation. It is argued that Lateglacial climate change, particularly increases in atmospheric CO2, shifted herbivore-ecosystem dynamics from a nutrient accelerating mode to a nutrient decelerating mode at the end of the Pleistocene, leading to reduced megafaunal population densities. An examination of Sporormiella records - a proxy for megaherbivore biomass - indicates that megafaunal populations collapsed first in the east and later in the west, possibly reflecting regional differences in precipitation or vegetation structure. The fortuitous intersection of the climatically driven nitrogen sink, followed by any one or combination of subsequent anthropogenic, environmental, or extra-terrestrial mechanisms could explain why extinctions took place at the end of the Pleistocene rather than during previous glacial-interglacial cycles. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Contemporary climate change is expected to affect the distributions of most species, but the nature, tempo, and mechanics of contemporary range shifts are still largely speculative. Here, we use fine-scale distributional records developed over the past Century, combined with spatially comprehensive microclimatic data, to demonstrate a dramatic shift in the range of a climate-sensitive mammal and to infer the increasingly important role of climate in local extinctions of this species across a 38.2 million-ha area. Changes in the distribution of the American pika (Ochotona princeps) throughout the Great Basin ecoregion were characterized using records from 1898-2008, revealing a nearly five-fold increase in the rate of local extinction and an 11-fold increase in the rate of upslope range retraction during the last ten years, compared with during the 20th Century. Four of ten local pika extinctions have occurred since 1999, and across this ecoregion the low-elevation range boundary for this species is now moving upslope at an average rate of about 145m per decade. The rapid, ecoregional range shift of this small, talus-dwelling species stands in remarkable contrast with the dynamics and determinants of endangerment previously observed for most terrestrial species, and to earlier extinction determinants for O. princeps in this region. Further investigation of widely distributed species will clarify rates at which biotic response to environmental change is occurring, and how factors driving that change are evolving in different portions of the earth. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The Early Toarcian mass extinction event represented the most important Mesozoic and Cenozoic turnover of the population of brachiopods and severely affected other benthic fauna. Two main hypotheses have been proposed to explain the synchronous and global mass extinction: an oceanic anoxic event or a warming episode. To test both hypotheses, the dynamics of the brachiopod assemblages below and above the extinction boundary are analyzed and compared with the seawater paleotemperature variations, calculated from the δ18O data recorded in belemnite rostra. Five sections from Northern and Central Spain, well dated with ammonites, have been selected for this study. The sections show no indication of sedimentary breaks and contain abundant brachiopods, which have been grouped into four assemblages. The changes observed in the brachiopod assemblages show a close correlation with the changes in the seawater paleotemperatures. The oldest assemblage (assemblage 1) coincides with a cooling interval recorded to have taken place in the latest Pliensbachian. Paleobiogeographical reconstruction shows that this assemblage was distributed at paleolatitudes between 30 and 45°N, with a preference for relatively cool waters. With the rise of temperatures that took place during the earliest Toarcian Tenuicostatum Zone, assemblage 1 was substituted by assemblage 2, which composed of different species of the same genera but considerably restricted to the warmer waters of lower paleolatitudes, between 28 and 35°N. Coinciding with the rapid and pronounced increase in seawater temperature, recorded at the Tenuicostatum-Serpentinum zonal boundary, all of these brachiopod species disappeared in the studied localities, marking clearly the extinction boundary. Predominant southward currents through the Laurasian Seaway precluded the possible migration of the brachiopods to cooler northern waters. The brachiopods' disappearance is independent from the oxygenation degree of the sea bottom, and therefore the rapid warming seems to be the most plausible cause of the mass extinction. After the extinction event, the recovery of the brachiopods was uneven. Subsequent to a brief pause, recovery was rapid in Central Spain and in other southern areas of Western Tethys, whereas in northern Spain and in the whole of Europe north of the French Central Massif, brachiopods did not recover until the Mid to Late Toarcian times. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Permian continental sequences from North China contain previously unrecognized episodes of plant radiation and elevated extinction. The earliest extinction, in the Lower Shihhotse Formation (Roadian, Guadalupian), records a 45% floral species loss and is tentatively correlated with global extinctions amongst dinocephalian reptiles. Two younger extinctions are dated by correlating the Illawara Reversal and palaeomagnetic polarity sequences from Shanxi Province against global palaeomagnetic history. Missing data from the Shanxi sequence are evaluated using a novel approach estimating likely maximum and minimum sequence changes that provide age estimates for post-Illawara events in North China. The second extinction in the middle Upper Shihhotse Formation is more significant and is dated to the mid-Capitanian, with a loss of 56% of plant species coinciding with two phases of volcanism of the Emeishan Large Igneous Province in South China, previously linked to the mid-Capitanian marine mass extinction. The youngest extinction in the upper Upper Shihhotse Formation (late Capitanian to mid-Wuchapingian) is catastrophic and represents the end of range in the sequence. Changes in sedimentary facies suggest it to be related to global climatic warming and drying. Other viable causal mechanisms for the extinction episodes include plate motion and collision, global climate change, volcanism and biological competition. © The Geological Society of London.},

abstract={We describe two events of water plant extinction in the Hula Valley, northern Israel: the ancient, natural extinction of 3 out of 14 extinct species at Gesher Benot Ya'aqov, which occurred some 800-700 k.yr., and an anthropogenic, near contemporary extinction of seven species in the artificial drainage of the Hula Lake in the 1950s. We conclude that the considerable fraction of water plants that disappeared from the Hula Valley in the Early-Middle Pleistocene was the result of habitat desiccation and not global warming. Thus, there is evidence that the hominins who lived in the Hula Valley inhabited a comparatively dry place. The disappearance of water plant species was partially the result of reduced seed dispersal by birds (ornitochory) as a result of the shrinkage of water bodies and their number along the Rift Valley. We suggest that the disappearance of a group of rare, local water plants can be used as an indicator of climate drying and impacts on the local vegetation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Recent climate change has caused the distributions of many species to shift poleward, yet few empirical studies have addressed which species will be vulnerable to longer-term climate changes. To investigate past consequences of climate change, we calculated the population extinction rates of 35 reptile species from 87 Greek land-bridge islands in the Mediterranean that occurred over the past 16,000 years. Population extinction rates were higher for those species that today have more northern distributions. We further found that northern species requiring cool, mesic habitats had less available suitable habitat among islands, implicating loss of suitable habitat in their elevated extinction rates. These extinctions occurred in the context of increasing habitat fragmentation, with islands shrinking and separating as sea levels rose. Thus, the circumstances faced by reptiles on the islands are similar to challenges for numerous species today that must cope with a changing climate while living in an increasingly human-fragmented landscape. Our island-biogeographical approach to investigating historical population extinctions gives insight into the long-term patterns of species responses to climate change. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract={Andean plant species are predicted to shift their distributions, or 'migrate,' upslope in response to future warming. The impacts of these shifts on species' population sizes and their abilities to persist in the face of climate change will depend on many factors including the distribution of individuals within species' ranges, the ability of species to migrate and remain at equilibrium with climate, and patterns of human land-use. Human land-use may be especially important in the Andes where anthropogenic activities above tree line may create a hard barrier to upward migrations, imperiling high-elevation Andean biodiversity. In order to better understand how climate change may impact the Andean biodiversity hotspot, we predict the distributional responses of hundreds of plant species to changes in temperature incorporating population density distributions, migration rates, and patterns of human land-use. We show that plant species from high Andean forests may increase their population sizes if able to migrate onto the expansive land areas above current tree line. However, if the pace of climate change exceeds species' abilities to migrate, all species will experience large population losses and consequently may face high risk of extinction. Using intermediate migration rates consistent with those observed for the region, most species are still predicted to experience population declines. Under a business-as-usual land-use scenario, we find that all species will experience large population losses regardless of migration rate. The effect of human land-use is most pronounced for high-elevation species that switch from predicted increases in population sizes to predicted decreases. The overriding influence of land-use on the predicted responses of Andean species to climate change can be viewed as encouraging since there is still time to initiate conservation programs that limit disturbances and/or facilitate the upward migration and persistence of Andean plant species. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Phelsuma parkeri Loveridge 1941 is an endemic gecko species native to the relatively flat island of Pemba (elevational range to < 100 m asl). Information on its distribution on the island and its conservation status is currently lacking. Herein, we provide information on the spatial distribution of P. parkeri and on its adaptability to habitat modification and changing climates. Our results imply that until now P. parkeri has been highly adaptable to anthropogenic habitat modification. A comparison with paleoclimatic conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum on Pemba has revealed that, in the past, P. parkeri and other endemic species on the island survived climatic conditions that were different from the current climatic conditions despite the absence of possibilities for compensating for these changes by means of altitudinal range shifts. We predict that P. parkeri is currently unlikely to be threatened by climate change. The main potential threat identified may be the introduction of invasive species such as Phelsuma dubia (Boettger 1881), which is already well established on the nearest island, i.e. on Zanzibar. Based on our findings, we propose that P. parkeri should be categorized as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List.},

A total of 93 megafauna dates for 15 genera, and 110 archaeological dates on early human appearance, are robust enough to assess correspondence between last-appearance records of megafauna, first-appearance records of humans, and the Younger Dryas to Holocene climatic transition in six different regions of South America. Interesting patterns come to light, but are based on few dates, particularly in northern South America. No taxon other than Mylodon has >7 robust dates, and many taxa have less than 3 dates. Accordingly, an assessment of how likely it is that only a few dates will yield the youngest date in an underlying frequency distribution of dates was conducted, by applying probability and bootstrapping analyses to 27 dates on Mylodon from southern Patagonia, 26 of them from a single site. It was found that 15 dates out of a sample of 27 will commonly yield a date within 200 years of the youngest date in the sample. For that reason, and because even for a taxon with many dates it is likely that the youngest dated specimen pre-dates the actual time of extinction, most of the last-appearance dates are interpreted as recording the last time taxa were abundant on the landscape, rather than extinction per se. With those caveats in mind, on a continental scale most megafauna have last appearances after human arrival, but seem to last at least 1000 years after first human presence. Some taxa apparently survived >6000 years after humans entered South America and >1000 years after the end-Pleistocene climatic changes. Last-appearance patterns for megafauna differ from region to region, but in Patagonia, the Argentine and Uruguayan Pampas, and Brazil, extinctions seem more common after humans arrive and during intensified climatic change between 11.2 and 13.5 ka. This pattern suggests that a synergy of human impacts and rapid climate change-analogous to what is happening today-may enhance extinction probability. Nevertheless, even in these regions, some megafauna persisted for thousands of years after human arrival and after the climate warmed. These results highlight the need for future intensive dating efforts on South American megafauna and archaeological remains. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.},

abstract={Madagascar's rainforests are among the most biodiverse in the world. Understanding the population dynamics of important species within these forests in response to past climatic variability provides valuable insight into current and future species composition. Here, we use a population-level approach to analyse palaeoecological records over the last 5300 years to understand how populations of Symphonia cf. verrucosa became locally extinct in some rainforest fragments along the southeast coast of Madagascar in response to rapid climate change, yet persisted in others. Our results indicate that regional (climate) variability contributed to synchronous decline of S. cf. verrucosa populations in these forests. Superimposed on regional fluctuations were local processes that could have contributed or mitigated extinction. Specifically, in the forest with low soil nutrients, population model predictions indicated that there was coexistence between S. cf. verrucosa and Erica spp., but in the nutrient-rich forest, interspecific effects between Symphonia and Erica spp. may have pushed Symphonia to extinction at the peak of climatic change. We also demonstrate that Symphonia is a good indicator of a threshold event, exhibiting erratic fluctuations prior to and long after the critical climatic point has passed. © 2009 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Climate change is causing many organisms to migrate to track climatically-suitable habitat. In many cases, this will happen naturally, but in others, human intervention may be necessary in the form of 'assisted colonisation'. Species re-establishments in suitable parts of their historic ranges provide an opportunity to conserve some species and to test ideas about assisted colonisation. Here, bioclimatic models of the distributions of two extinct British butterflies, Aporia crataegi and Polyommatus semiargus, were used to investigate the potential for re-establishment in Britain. Generalised additive models and generalised linear models were created to describe the species' European distributions for the period 1961-1990. All models projected the British climate during this period to be suitable for both species. Thirty-year climate projections for the periods 1991-2020 and 2021-2050, and for three climate change scenarios, were then put into the models to generate projections of climatic suitability throughout the 21st century. British climate was projected to remain highly suitable for A. crataegi, but to decline somewhat for P. semiargus. Southern and eastern Britain were found to be the areas most likely to support suitable climate. This difference between the species appeared to be due in part to decreasing summer rainfall in climate change projections, as this should only benefit A. crataegi. It is concluded that, with further study of habitat requirements, both species could be reintroduced to Britain as part of a long-term European conservation strategy. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Elucidating the spatio-temporal distributions of terrestrial plants is a key for interpreting the origin of distribution patterns and the tempo of intercontinental disjunction. Nordenskioeldia was distributed in eastern Asia and North America from the Late Cretaceous to the Miocene. Its fossil record provides important information on former patterns of disjunction and dispersal in the Northern Hemisphere. New specimens from the Paleocene of China allow us to further extend the history of the group and provide the impetus to review its distribution in space and time. The comparative morphological survey on fossil Nordenskioeldia found in the Paleocene sediments in both eastern Asia and North America confirms that they belonged to the same morpho-species, which indicates a close floristic continuity between both continents due to land connection available during that time. The spatio-temporal distributions of Nordenskioeldia indicate that the taxon probably expanded eastward from eastern Asia into North America by the end of Early/Middle Maastrichtian, subsequently colonized Greenland, northeastern North America and Spitsbergen in the Early Paleocene, and finally became extinct in the Miocene. The fluctuations in its northern limits took place in response to climate changes: warming from the Paleocene to the Eocene, cooling during the Eocene-Oligocene and amelioration during the Late Oligocene-Mid-Miocene.

abstract={Species responses to climate change may be influenced by changes in available habitat, as well as population processes, species interactions and interactions between demographic and landscape dynamics. Current methods for assessing these responses fail to provide an integrated view of these influences because they deal with habitat change or population dynamics, but rarely both. In this study, we linked a time series of habitat suitability models with spatially explicit stochastic population models to explore factors that influence the viability of plant species populations under stable and changing climate scenarios in South African fynbos, a global biodiversity hot spot. Results indicate that complex interactions between life history, disturbance regime and distribution pattern mediate species extinction risks under climate change. Our novel mechanistic approach allows more complete and direct appraisal of future biotic responses than do static bioclimatic habitat modelling approaches, and will ultimately support development of more effective conservation strategies to mitigate biodiversity losses due to climate change. © 2008 The Royal Society.},

abstract={The last major global revolution of climate was the transition from the last glacial stage to the present interglacial, ca. 25-10 ka. Vegetational belts and mammalian communities underwent major reorganisation. New radiocarbon data show that the complex series of climatic changes affected the ranges of mammalian species dramatically, but in differing ways related to the ecologies of individual species. For species that ultimately went extinct, the reduction in range was a prolonged and geographically complex process taking thousands or tens of thousands of years. Recent genetic studies using ancient DNA show that this process was often accompanied by loss of genetic variation and, presumably, adaptive flexibility. Even so, some species survived for thousands of years in small, terminal refugia before finally becoming extinct - a pattern akin to the 'extinction lag' or 'extinction debt' posited for endangered modern taxa. Whether refugial species can survive to re-expand into new areas, especially in anthropogenically disturbed environments, is determined by a complex of factors and is not inevitable. © 2008 Académie des sciences.},

Declines in abundance are associated with bleaching and diseases driven by elevated sea surface temperatures, with extinction risk further exacerbated by local-scale anthropogenic disturbances. The proportion of corals threatened with extinction has increased dramatically in recent decades and exceeds that of most terrestrial groups. The Caribbean has the largest proportion of corals in high extinction risk categories, whereas the Coral Triangle (western Pacific) has the highest proportion of species in all categories of elevated extinction risk.

abstract={Woolly mammoths inhabited Eurasia and North America from late Middle Pleistocene (300 ky BP [300,000 years before present]), surviving through different climatic cycles until they vanished in the Holocene (3.6 ky BP). The debate about why the Late Quaternary extinctions occurred has centred upon environmental and human-induced effects, or a combination of both. However, testing these two hypotheses - climatic and anthropogenic - has been hampered by the difficulty of generating quantitative estimates of the relationship between the contraction of the mammoth's geographical range and each of the two hypotheses. We combined climate envelope models and a population model with explicit treatment of woolly mammoth-human interactions to measure the extent to which a combination of climate changes and increased human pressures might have led to the extinction of the species in Eurasia. Climate conditions for woolly mammoths were measured across different time periods: 126 ky BP, 42 ky BP, 30 ky BP, 21 ky BP, and 6 ky BP. We show that suitable climate conditions for the mammoth reduced drastically between the Late Pleistocene and the Holocene, and 90% of its geographical range disappeared between 42 ky BP and 6 ky BP, with the remaining suitable areas in the mid-Holocene being mainly restricted to Arctic Siberia, which is where the latest records of woolly mammoths in continental Asia have been found. Results of the population models also show that the collapse of the climatic niche of the mammoth caused a significant drop in their population size, making woolly mammoths more vulnerable to the increasing hunting pressure from human populations. The coincidence of the disappearance of climatically suitable areas for woolly mammoths and the increase in anthropogenic impacts in the Holocene, the coup de grâce, likely set the place and time for the extinction of the woolly mammoth. © 2008 Nogués-Bravo et al.},

abstract={Limitations imposed on species ranges by the climatic, ecological, and physiological effects of elevation are important determinants of extinction risk. We modeled the effects of elevational limits on the extinction risk of landbirds, 87% of all bird species. Elevational limitation of range size explained 97% of the variation in the probability of being in a World Conservation Union category of extinction risk. Our model that combined elevational ranges, four Millennium Assessment habitat-loss scenarios, and an intermediate estimate of surface warming of 2.8° C, projected a best guess of 400-550 landbird extinctions, and that approximately 2150 additional species would be at risk of extinction by 2100. For Western Hemisphere landbirds, intermediate extinction estimates based on climate-induced changes in actual distributions ranged from 1.3% (1.1° C warming) to 30.0% (6.4° C warming) of these species. Worldwide, every degree of warming projected a nonlinear increase in bird extinctions of about 100-500 species. Only 21% of the species predicted to become extinct in our scenarios are currently considered threatened with extinction. Different habitat-loss and surface-warming scenarios predicted substantially different futures for landbird species. To improve the precision of climate-induced extinction estimates, there is an urgent need for high-resolution measurements of shifts in the elevational ranges of species. Given the accelerating influence of climate change on species distributions and conservation, using elevational limits in a tested, standardized, and robust manner can improve conservation assessments of terrestrial species and will help identify species that are most vulnerable to global climate change. Our climate-induced extinction estimates are broadly similar to those of bird species at risk from other factors, but these estimates largely involve different sets of species. © 2008 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={Thermal considerations can help resolve two of the most challenging problems in later Palaeolithic archaeology - the demise of Neanderthals and the emergence of modern human behaviour. Both can be viewed as reflecting interactions between biological and behavioural cold adaptations, in the context of extreme climatic fluctuations during the Upper Pleistocene. Recent studies draw attention to the special difficulties these conditions posed for humans but few give sufficient regard to the need for adequate pre-adaptations, namely technologies for manufacturing complex clothing assemblages. It is argued here that pre-existing biological cold adaptations delayed the development of such technological capacities among Neanderthals, resulting ultimately in their extinction. In contrast, the greater biological vulnerability of fully modern humans promoted a precocious appearance of behavioural adaptations among some (though not all) groups, visible in the various archaeological markers of modern human behaviour.},

abstract={Abalone abundance surveys from the 1970s were repeated 30 yrs later following a period of increased sea surface temperatures along the Pacific coast of the United States. Northern abalone, Haliotis kamtschatkana (Jonas, 1845) once abundant enough to support commercial fishing in Washington and Canada, are now extremely rare in the southern portion of their range in southern and central California. They have also declined 10 fold in northern California in the absence of human fishing pressure. In Washington, northern abalone are in decline and exhibit recruitment failure despite closure of the fishery. Flat abalone, Haliotis walallensis (Stearns, 1899) no longer occur in southern California, and in central California have declined from 32% to 8% of the total number of abalones, Haliotis spp., inside a marine reserve. The distribution of flat abalone appears to have contracted over time such that they are now only common in southern Oregon where they are subject to a new commercial fishery. Given these range reductions, the long-term persistence of flat abalone and northern abalone (locally) is a concern in light of threats from ocean warming, sea otter predation, and the flat abalone fishery in Oregon. The likelihood of future ocean warming poses challenges for abalone restoration, suggesting that improved monitoring and protection will be critical, especially in the northern portions of their distributions. © 2007 Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami.},

abstract={Little is known about climate changes on Flores that influenced Homo floresiensis during the period of occupation of Liang Bua (95-12 ka)or the late-surviving pygmy Stegodon lineage; both species became locally extinct at ca. 12 ka. Previous palaeoclimate analysis in this region has established that a prolonged dry period (ca. 45-12 ka) was followed by a rapid increase in rainfall, but lacks a firm chronology. Here we report initial results for stalagmites from western Flores and eastern Java. Using δ18O data from contemporaneous records, a series of isotopic shifts has been identified that reflects changes in the amount of rainfall, and in moisture sources. The isotopic signals from oxygen and carbon suggest differing ages for the rapid increase in rainfall, at ca. 13 ka and 17-16.5 ka, respectively. Thus, it cannot be determined from this evidence whether the abrupt disappearance of Stegodon and Homo floresiensis in western Flores was coincident with a major change in climate, or was caused instead, or as well, by a volcanic eruption at ca. 12 ka, or was related to the arrival of Homo sapiens at Liang Bua by ca. 10.5 ka.

abstract={The threat of global warming to rare species is a growing concern, yet few studies have predicted its effects on rare populations. Using demographic data gathered in both drought and nondrought years between 1996-2003 in central Arizona upper Sonoran Desert, we modeled population viability for the federally endangered Purshia subintegra (Kearney) Henrickson (Arizona cliffrose). We used deterministic matrix projection models and stochastic models simulating weather conditions during our study, given historical weather variation and under scenarios of increased aridity. Our models suggest that the P. subintegra population in Verde Valley is slowly declining and will be at greater risk of extinction with increased aridity. Across patches at a fine spatial scale, demographic performance was associated with environmental factors. Moist sites (patches with the highest soil moisture, lowest sand content, and most northern aspects) had the highest densities, highest seedling recruitment, and highest risk of extinction over the shortest time span. Extinction risk in moist sites was exacerbated by higher variance in recruitment and mortality. Dry sites had higher cumulative adult survival and lower extinction risk but negative growth rates. Steps necessary for the conservation of the species include introductions at more northern latitudes and in situ manipulations to enhance seedling recruitment and plant survival. We demonstrate that fine spatial-scale modeling is necessary to predict where patches with highest extinction risk or potential refugia for rare species may occur. Because current climate projections for the 21st century imply range shifts at rates of 300 to 500 km/century, which are beyond even exceptional examples of shifts in the fossil record of 100-150 km, it is likely that preservation of many rare species will require human intervention and a long-term commitment. Global warming conditions are likely to reduce the carrying capacity of many rare species' habitats. ©2006 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={Widespread extinction is a predicted ecological consequence of global warming. Extinction risk under climate change scenarios is a function of distribution breadth. Focusing on trees and birds of the eastern United States, we used joint climate and environment models to examine fit and climate change vulnerability as a function of distribution breadth. We found that extinction vulnerability increases with decreasing distribution size. We also found that model fit decreases with decreasing distribution size, resulting in high prediction uncertainty among narrowly distributed species. High prediction uncertainty creates a conservation dilemma in that excluding these species under-predicts extinction risk and favors mistaken inaction on global warming. By contrast, including narrow endemics results in overpredicting extinction risk and promotes mistaken inaction on behalf of individual species prematurely considered doomed to extinction. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Aim Concern over the implications of climate change for biodiversity has led to the use of species-climate 'envelope' models to forecast risks of species extinctions under climate change scenarios. Recent studies have demonstrated significant variability in model projections and there remains a need to test the accuracy of models and to reduce uncertainties. Testing of models has been limited by a lack of data against which projections of future ranges can be tested. Here we provide a first test of the predictive accuracy of such models using observed species' range shifts and climate change in two periods of the recent past. Location Britain. Methods Observed range shifts for 116 breeding bird species in Britain between 1967 and 1972 (t 1) and 1987-91 (t 2) are used. We project range shifts between t 1, and t 2 for each species based on observed climate using 16 alternative models (4 methods × 2 data parameterizations × 2 rules to transform probabilities of occurrence into presence and absence records). Results Modelling results were extremely variable, with projected range shifts varying both in magnitude and in direction from observed changes and from each other. However, using approaches that explore the central tendency (consensus) of model projections, we were able to improve agreement between projected and observed shifts significantly. Conclusions Our results provide the first empirical evidence of the value of speciesclimate 'envelope' models under climate change and demonstrate reduction in uncertainty and improvement in accuracy through selection of the most consensual projections. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

We combined two scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change with a global hydrological model to build global scenarios of future losses in river discharge from climate change and increased water withdrawal. Applying these results to known relationships between fish species and discharge, we build scenarios of losses (at equilibrium) of riverine fish richness. In rivers with reduced discharge, up to 75% (quartile range 4-22%) of local fish biodiversity would be headed toward extinction by 2070 because of combined changes in climate and water consumption. Fish loss in the scenarios fell disproportionately on poor countries. Reductions in water consumption could prevent many of the extinctions in these scenarios. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Here we use an in-depth example, the multispecies modeling effort that has been conducted for the proteas of the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, to illustrate lessons learned in this and other multispecies modeling efforts. Modeling shows that a substantial number of species may lose all suitable range and many may lose all representation in protected areas as a result of climate change, while a much larger number may experience major loss in the amount of their range that is protected.

abstract={Aim. Theoretical work suggests that species' ecological niches should remain relatively constant over long-term ecological time periods, but empirical tests are few. We present longitudinal studies of 23 extant mammal species, modelling ecological niches and predicting geographical distributions reciprocally between the Last Glacial Maximum and present to test this evolutionary conservatism. Location. This study covered distributional shifts in mammal species across the lower 48 states of the United States. Methods. We used a machine-learning tool for modelling species' ecological niches, based on known occurrences and electronic maps summarizing ecological dimensions, to assess the ability of ecological niches as modelled in one time period to predict the geographical distribution of the species in another period, and vice versa. Results. High intertemporal predictivity between niche models and species' occurrences indicate that niche conservatism is widespread among the taxa studied, particularly when statistical power is considered as a reason for failure of reciprocal predictions. Niche projections to the present for 8 mammal taxa that became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene generally increased in area, and thus do not support the hypothesis of niche collapse as a major driving force in their extinction. Main conclusions. Ecological niches represent long-term stable constraints on the distributional potential of species; indeed, this study suggests that mammal species have tracked consistent climate profiles throughout the drastic climate change events that marked the end of the Pleistocene glaciations. Many current modelling efforts focusing on anticipating climate change effects on species' potential geographical distributions will be bolstered by this result - in essence, the first longitudinal demonstration of niche conservatism. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Climate change over the past ∼30 years has produced numerous shifts in the distributions and abundances of species and has been implicated in one species-level extinction. Using projections of species' distributions for future climate scenarios, we assess extinction risks for sample regions that cover some 20% of the Earth's terrestrial surface. Exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a power-law relationship with geographical range size, we predict, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15-37% of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be 'committed to extinction'. When the average of the three methods and two dispersal scenarios is taken, minimal climate-warming scenarios produce lower projections of species committed to extinction (∼18%) than mid-range (∼24%) and maximum-change (∼35%) scenarios. These estimates show the importance of rapid implementation of technologies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and strategies for carbon sequestration.},

abstract={Terrestrial climates near the time of the end-Cretaceous mass extinction are poorly known, limiting understanding of environmentally driven changes in biodiversity that occurred before bolide impact. We estimate paleotemperatures for the last ≈1.1 million years of the Cretaceous (≈66.6-65.5 million years ago, Ma) by using fossil plants from North Dakota and employ paleomagnetic stratigraphy to correlate the results to foraminiferal paleoclimatic data from four middle- and high-latitude sites. Both plants and foraminifera indicate warming near 66.0 Ma, a warming peak from ≈65.8 to 65.6 Ma, and cooling near 65.6 Ma, suggesting that these were global climate shifts. The warming peak coincides with the immigration of a thermophilic flora, maximum plant diversity, and the poleward range expansion of thermophilic foraminifera. Plant data indicate the continuation of relatively cool temperatures across the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary; there is no indication of a major warming immediately after the boundary as previously reported. Our temperature proxies correspond well with recent pCO2 data from paleosol carbonate, suggesting a coupling of pCO2 and temperature. To the extent that biodiversity is correlated with temperature, estimates of the severity of end-Cretaceous extinctions that are based on occurrence data from the warming peak are probably inflated, as we illustrate for North Dakota plants. However, our analysis of climate and facies considerations shows that the effects of bolide impact should be regarded as the most significant contributor to these plant extinctions.},

Predictions of climate-induced population extinctions are supported by geographic range shifts that correspond to climatic warming, but few extinctions have been linked mechanistically to climate change. Here we show that extinctions of two populations of a checkerspot butterfly were hastened by increasing variability in precipitation, a phenomenon predicted by global climate models. We model checkerspot populations to show that changes in precipitation amplified population fluctuations, leading to rapid extinctions. As populations of checkerspots and other species become further isolated by habitat loss, climate change is likely to cause more extinctions, threatening both species diversity and critical ecosystem services.},

abstract={A major extinction of terrestrial plants occurred at the end of the Westphalian (Middle Pennsylvanian) in the lowland tropics of North America. Approximately 67% of the species in peat-forming mires, and at least half the species in clastic wetlands were eliminated by changing climatic conditions, probably protracted moisture deficits or exaggeration of seasonal dryness. Independent studies suggest that the end of the Westphalian was marked by deglaciation in Gondwana and increase in global temperature. In peat-forming habitats major fioristic changes followed the extinction. Earliesta Stephanian (Late Pennsylvanian) dominance-diversity patterns were highly variable temporally; several different plant groups that were of minor importance in Westphalian mires became major framework dominants, with high coal to coal variability. Ultimately opportunistic tree ferns, previously subdominant, became the dominant elements. Westphalian tree ferns were mostly small, cheaply constructed colonists with massive reproductive outputs and broad ecological amplitudes. Stephanian tree ferns were much larger and appear to have occupied sites for extended periods; they retained the cheap construction of earlier forms but added massive root mantles, which permitted greater height and girth. The 'marsh'-forming lycopsid Chaloncria also became common in Stephanian mires. These elements formed mire landscapes that had few analogues in the older Westphalian mire forests, dominated by tree lycopsids. Generic dominance patterns in the Stephanian became fairly consistent after the initial period of irregularity; however, the species composition of Stephanian mires was highly variable within generic themes. Ecological assemblages were persistent during most of the Westphalian and Stephanian. Patterns at the end-Westphalian suggest that high levels of species extinction disrupt self-regulatory properties of groups of species and create intervals of lottery-like ecological dynamics. Opportunists may have an advantage during these periods, but ultimately they must give rise to species capable of site occupation. Thus the size of the extinction, and the proximity of existing species that can recolonize vacated resource space, will dictate whether speciation or colonization will rebuild the new landscapes.},

abstract={A major floral change occurs in the Upper Pennsylvanian strata in the Midcontinent, Illinois basin, and in the northern Appalachian basin of eastern United States. Lycospora spp. (derived from arborescent lycopsids) became extinct along with some other palynomorph taxa. This investigation is concerned with the importance of this major floral change. Samples were studied from western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, and West Virginia (from a previous study) cover the stratigraphic interval from the Upper Freeport coal bed, uppermost part of the Allegheny Formation, to the Mahoning, Mason, Brush Creek, Wilgus, and Anderson coal beds in the lower part of the Conemaugh Formation. The floral change occurs either at or below the accepted Desmoinesian-Missourian boundary in the Midcontinent and Illinois basin, whereas in the northern Appalachians this change occurs in the lower part of the Conemaugh Formation, between the Mahoning and Brush Creek coal beds, or when the Mason is present, between the Mahoning and Mason coal beds. With the advent of late Middle Pennsylvanian time, the climate began to change from wet tropical to seasonal tropical. The Middle-Upper Pennsylvanian boundary is the culmination of this drying trend, which was marked by reduction of available water. The peat swamps are interpreted as having changed from the domed type of bog to the planar type under these circumstances. Thus, in general, the coals of the Conemaugh Formation are characteristically much thinner than those of the Allegheny Formation. This was caused by a number of factors including reduced or more seasonal rainfall, decline of arborescent lycopsids, and the increased dominance of herbaceous and fern plants. As a result, there are fewer minable coal beds in the Conemaugh Formation. The first coal bed above the extinction of Lycospora spp. is dominated by the palynomorph taxon Endosporites globiformis which is derived from a heterosporous, herbaceous lycopsid. However, Sigillaria, another arborescent lycopsid, did not become extinct at this time as evidenced by the presence of the palynomorph genus Crassispora which is derived from Sigillaria. The reason for the survival of Sigillaria is not known, but it may have been able to adapt, in a limited fashion, to some sort of specialized microenvironment. The ferns, based on palynomorph occurrence, become numerically more important throughout the balance of the Conemaugh Formation, and dominate the Pittsburgh No. 8 and Pomeroy coal beds in the overlying Monogahela Formation.},

abstract={Slowly changing boundary conditions can sometimes cause discontinuous responses in climate models and result in relatively rapid transitions between different climate states. Such terrestrially induced abrupt climate transitions could have contributed to biotic crises in earth history. Ancillary events associated with transitions could disperse unstable climate behavior over a longer but still geologically brief interval and account for the stepwise nature of some extinction events. There is a growing body of theoretical and empirical support for the concept of abrupt climate change, and a comparison of paleoclimate data with the Phanerozoic extinction record indicates that climate and biotic transitions often coincide. However, more stratigraphic information is needed to precisely assess phase relations between the two types of transitions. The climate-life comparison also suggests that, if climate change is significantly contributing to biotic turnover, ecosystems may be more sensitive to forcing during the early stages of evolution from an ice-free to a glaciated state. Our analysis suggests that a terrestrially induced climate instability is a viable mechanism for causing rapid environmental change and biotic turnover in earth history, but the relation is not so strong that other sources of variance can be excluded.},

abstract={The goal of classifying shock metamorphic features in meteorites is to estimate the corresponding shock pressure conditions. However, the temperature variability of shock metamorphism is equally important and can result in a diverse and heterogeneous set of shock features in samples with a common overall shock pressure. In particular, high-pressure (HP) minerals, which were previously used as a solid indicator of high shock pressure in meteorites, require complex pressure–temperature–time (P–T–t) histories to form and survive. First, parts of the sample must be heated to melting temperatures, at high pressure, to enable rapid formation of HP minerals before pressure release. Second, the HP minerals must be rapidly cooled to below a critical temperature, before the pressure returns to ambient conditions, to avoid retrograde transformation to their low-pressure polymorphs. These two constraints require the sample to contain large temperature heterogeneities, e.g. melt veins in a cooler groundmass, during shock. In this study, we calculated shock temperatures and possible P–T paths of chondritic and differentiated mafic–ultramafic rocks for various shock pressures. These P–T conditions and paths, combined with observations from shocked meteorites, are used to constrain shock conditions and P–T–t histories of HP-mineral bearing samples. The need for rapid thermal quench of HP phases requires a relatively low bulk-shock temperature and therefore moderate shock pressures below ~ 30 GPa, which matches the stabilities of these HP minerals. The low-temperature moderate-pressure host rock generally shows moderate shock-deformation features consistent with S4 and, less commonly, S5 shock stages. Shock pressures in excess of 50 GPa in meteorites result in melt breccias with high overall post-shock temperatures that anneal out HP-mineral signatures. The presence of ringwoodite, which is commonly considered an indicator of the S6 shock stage, is inconsistent with pressures in excess of 30 GPa and does not represent shock conditions different from S4 shock conditions. Indeed, ringwoodite and coexisting HP minerals should be considered as robust evidence for moderate shock pressures (S4) rather than extreme shock (S6) near whole-rock melting.

abstract={Emplacement of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) is thought to have triggered global environmental changes and the end-Triassic mass extinction (ETE). However, the mechanisms linking volcanism and environmental change are unclear. Here we provide new insight into these linkages by measuring the abundance of both sedimentary five- to six-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and mercury from strata deposited in shallow marine environments across the ETE at the GSSP Kuhjoch section in Austria and St. Audrie's Bay section in the UK. To contextualize these data, we report results from laboratory experiments measuring the production of SO2 and CO2 during heating of limestone and mudstone. ETE sediments record parallel enrichments of mercury and five- to six-ring PAHs, which could have been produced by intrusive magma (mainly sills) and lava flows during the early stage of the CAMP emplacement; these data indicate a direct link between massive gas emission from sill contact metamorphism and the ETE. The fraction of coronene – a highly condensed six-ring PAH that requires greater energy to form compared to smaller PAHs – accumulated in the sediments during these initial volcanic events is low, and it coincides with the terrestrial plant turnover and initial marine extinction. Coronene increases to medium values coinciding with the final marine extinction level. Our heating experiments of typical carbonate and mudstone materials show that relatively low temperature heating (&gt;350 °C) by sills releases massive amounts of SO2 on a 100 yr time scale, whereas higher temperature heating (500–600 °C) forms more CO2 on the same time scale. The combination of our end-Triassic geochemical data and laboratory results implies that low heating by sills caused SO2-dominated gas emission to the stratosphere and low CO2 emission, inducing global cooling that could have precipitated the mass extinction. The subsequent increase in coronene content indicates higher volcanic temperature that would have volatilized CO2 rich gas; the consequence was a switch to greater CO2 release and long-term (&gt;105 yr) global warming. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Climate change is a critical factor affecting biodiversity. However, the quantitative relationship between temperature change and extinction is unclear. Here, we analyze magnitudes and rates of temperature change and extinction rates of marine fossils through the past 450 million years (Myr). The results show that both the rate and magnitude of temperature change are significantly positively correlated with the extinction rate of marine animals. Major mass extinctions in the Phanerozoic can be linked to thresholds in climate change (warming or cooling) that equate to magnitudes >5.2 °C and rates >10 °C/Myr. The significant relationship between temperature change and extinction still exists when we exclude the five largest mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic. Our findings predict that a temperature increase of 5.2 °C above the pre-industrial level at present rates of increase would likely result in mass extinction comparable to that of the major Phanerozoic events, even without other, non-climatic anthropogenic impacts. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Rare species population dynamics can elucidate the resilience of an ecosystem. On coral reefs, climate change and local anthropogenic stressors are threatening stony coral persistence, increasing the need to assess vulnerable species locally. Here, we monitored the threatened pillar coral, Dendrogyra cylindrus, population in southeast Florida, USA, in relation to consecutive heat stress events in 2014 and 2015. In the fall of each year, D. cylindrus colonies bleached following intense thermal stress and by June 2020 all monitored colonies died from a white-syndrome type disease. This resulted in the ecological extinction of D. cylindrus in the Southeast Florida Coral Reef Ecosystem Conservation Area (ECA). White-syndrome type disease was first seen in February 2014 on four colonies (19% prevalence) near the major international port, Port Everglades and disease prevalence peaked in fall 2015 (58%). Disease prevalence increased with maximum water temperature, while disease related mortality increased with mean water temperature. Our findings suggest that thermal stress exacerbated underlying stony coral disease, resulting in an outbreak contributing to the ecological extirpation of D. cylindrus in the ECA. We suggest that stony coral resilience is severely compromised by chronic environmental disturbance which hinders community recovery. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Extreme warming at the end-Permian induced profound changes in marine biogeochemical cycling and animal habitability, leading to the largest metazoan extinction in Earth’s history. However, a causal mechanism for the extinction that is consistent with various proxy records of geochemical conditions through the interval has yet to be determined. Here we combine an Earth system model with global and local redox interpretations from the Permian/Triassic in an attempt to identify this causal mechanism. Our results show that a temperature-driven increase in microbial respiration can reconcile reconstructions of the spatial distribution of euxinia and seafloor anoxia spanning the Permian–Triassic transition. We illustrate how enhanced metabolic rates would have strengthened upper-ocean nutrient (phosphate) recycling, and thus shoaled and intensified the oxygen minimum zones, eventually causing euxinic waters to expand onto continental shelves and poison benthic habitats. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the sensitive interconnections between temperature, microbial metabolism, ocean redox state and carbon cycling during the end-Permian mass extinction. As enhanced microbial activity in the ocean interior also lowers subsurface dissolved inorganic carbon isotopic values, the carbon release as inferred from isotope changes in shallow subsurface carbonates is likely overestimated, not only for this event, but perhaps for many other carbon cycle and climate perturbations through Earth’s history. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract={In this study, emission and extinction spectroscopy were combined to in situ measure temperature and volume fraction distributions of liquid germanium nanoparticle gas-phase synthesized in an argon/hydrogen/germane flow through a microwave plasma. Emission of the hot particles and extinction against a continuous background were recorded by a spectrometer in the 380-703 nm and 230-556 nm ranges, respectively, selected based on the specific optical properties of the material. Absorption coefficients were deconvoluted from line-of-sight attenuation (LOSA) measurements by a least-square algorithm and then used to determine the local volume fraction distribution. The temperature field was derived from the line-of-sight emission (LOSE) spectra with the prior knowledge of absorption coefficients. A multi-wavelength reconstruction model was developed for the determination of the spatially-resolved distribution of the measured quantities assuming a stationary axisymmetric flow. Advantages of the method include experimental simplicity, low cost, and adaptability to up-scaled reactor sizes. © 2021 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement.},

abstract={This work utilized an in-house synthesized aryl polyester, poly (decamethylene terephthalate) (PDT), to investigate the crystal assembly of unique camellia-flower-like extinction bands periodically assembled in spherulites formed at specific Tc's or driven by other kinetic factors. These extinction PDT bands at high Tc's (110–125 °C) and confined in thin films are packed by parallel flat plates of single-crystal-like dimensions in nanometer to micrometer scales (measuring 4 μm × 4 μm x 20 nm) self-assembled as terrace-like shingles that are bordered with an optically extinct boundary. The valley corresponds to where most amorphous ingredients accumulate and the growth precipitates suddenly from tip of ridge to near the substrate, resulting in an optical extinction border. All ridges (convex bands) are composed of discrete crystal plates aligned as roof-shingle stacks along the circumferential bands, and the crystals do not traverse across the bands. These lamellae on ridge bands are discrete and do not twist at all or rotate 360° angle continuously extending from nucleus to periphery. The circular-extinction bands of PDT of nanometer films (300–400 nm) are composed of parallel lamellae with the terrace alignment pointing along the circumferential direction; the epicycloid-extinction bands of thicker PDT specimens (2000–3000 nm) are assembled with single-crystal plates of lozenge shapes and aligned in growth-preferred directions to form petal-like tips. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The larvae of some amphibian species grow and develop more slowly at lower temperature and attain larger body size at the end of metamorphosis, but this is not true for all amphibians. We have for the first time provided empirical data by using a combination of field and lab-based studies with a robust sample size (360 adults, 1000 tadpoles) for Hazara Torrent Frog (Allopaa hazarensis) and Murree Hills Frog (Nanorana vicina). In this study, we examined how tadpoles responded to different temperatures through metamorphosis, body size, developmental complications or deformities, fitness and survival. We found that the tadpoles of A. hazarensis and N. vicina showed the same response to elevated temperatures under laboratory conditions including faster metamorphosis, reduction in the body size, more frequent developmental complications or deformities such as edema and tail kinks, lower fitness and higher mortality at elevated temperatures (>26 °C). The comparison of thermal sensitivity between the two species showed that N. vicina was more sensitive to higher temperatures. Pakistan has been experiencing changes in climatic patterns, and the ecosystems in northern Pakistan are losing biodiversity due to increasing temperature, frequency of drought and intensity of floods. It is feared that these frogs may experience local extinction in future. Our findings contribute to filling the information gap regarding impacts of temperature increase on biodiversity of high altitude forested montane ecosystems and is an important contribution to future studies associating biodiversity and climate change. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

The correlation was developed with the data collected from Sullivan-Lewis' experiments of methane and hydrogen mixtures at elevated temperatures and pressures, similar to gas turbine conditions. Recent flame stability studies have since appeared in literature and has allowed for inspection of the validity of the predictive flame extinction boundary correlation with new data. The blow-off boundary correlation is also examined with previous flame blow off studies with significant variances of parameters compared to the original study used to build the correlation. The data used for comparison differ with fuel type, equivalence ratios, pressures, temperatures, turbulence intensities, and flameholder geometries. The analysis concludes that the predictive flame extinction correlation developed is able to accurately predict a wide range of extinction conditions reported in the literature. However, it is observed that the correlation is not able to fully capture the behavior of the data for conditions in which turbulence intensities are above 5%. © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Besides, the influence of two types of measured signal noises, i.e. the laser signal noise and the light-field image signal noise, on the reconstructed quality have been investigated thoroughly. The Landweber method is adopted to solve the inverse analysis.

abstract={We evaluate the degradation of the accuracy of the component separation between the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and foreground components caused by neglect of absorption of the CMB's monopole component by the galactic interstellar matter. The amplitude of the temperature anisotropy caused by the CMB shadow, due to dust components, is about 1 μK. This value is comparable to the required noise level necessary to probe non-Gaussianity studies with upcoming CMB experiments. In addition, the amplitude of the polarization caused by the CMB shadow due to dust is comparable to or larger than the rms value of the CMB B-mode polarization, imprinted by primordial gravitational waves. We show that applying a single-power-law model as the dust spectrum to observed multifrequency data introduces systematic errors, which are comparable to or larger than the required noise level for forthcoming CMB B-mode polarization experiments. Deducing the intrinsic spectrum of dust emission from the submillimeter wave band data reduces the systematic error to below the required noise level. However, this method requires dust temperature measurements with an accuracy of better than a few percent. We conclude that the CMB shadow due to dust must be considered in future CMB missions for achieving their targeted sensitivity.

abstract={Significant reductions in populations of tsetse (Glossina spp) in parts of Zimbabwe have been attributed to increases in temperature over recent decades. Sustained increases in temperature might lead to local extinctions of tsetse populations. Extinction probabilities for tsetse populations have not so far been estimated as a function of temperature. We develop a time-homogeneous branching process model for situations where tsetse live at different levels of fixed temperature. We derive a probability distribution pk(T) for the number of female offspring an adult female tsetse is expected to produce in her lifetime, as a function of the fixed temperature at which she is living. We show that pk(T) can be expressed as a geometric series: its generating function is therefore a fractional linear type. We obtain expressions for the extinction probability, reproduction number, time to extinction and growth rates. The results are valid for all tsetse, but detailed effects of temperature will vary between species. No G. m. morsitans population can escape extinction if subjected, for extended periods, to temperatures outside the range 16˚C–32˚C. Extinction probability increases more rapidly as temperatures approach and exceed the upper and lower limits. If the number of females is large enough, the population can still survive even at high temperatures (28˚C–31˚C). Small decreases or increases in constant temperature in the neighbour-hoods of 16˚C and 31˚C, respectively, can drive tsetse populations to extinction. Further study is needed to estimate extinction probabilities for tsetse populations in field situations where temperatures vary continuously. © 2020 Are, Hargrove.},

abstract={Synthesis of well-dispersed palladium nanoparticles within silica aerogel pores with controlled size was carried out using sol-gel synthesis under supercritical ethanol drying. The high concentration of silanol groups on silica (SiO2) surface facilitated a superior palladium (Pd) loading up to 10 wt %. The synthesized Pd/SiO2 nanocomposite aerogels were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic methods. The silica aerogel supported catalysts were found to have a wide pore size distribution. TEM investigations confirmed that Pd nanocrystals were located within the SiO2 microspores and mesopores. The catalyst was evaluated for carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation reaction under ignition/extinction conditions. The synthesized catalyst demonstrated a high catalytic activity at low operating temperatures (&lt;200 °C) compared to unsupported Pd nanoparticles or bare SiO2 aerogels. This enhancement in CO oxidation activity with Pd/SiO2 aerogel catalysts are attributed to the small Pd particles, Pd interaction with the surface of the underlying SiO2 and the better dispersion of Pd particles within the SiO2 pores. Porosity played a more important role during the extinction cycle as a result of the slow dissipation of the heat leading to hysteresis. We demonstrate the influence of porosity of catalyst supports on the size, dispersion, and catalytic activity of Pd nanoparticles. © 2019},

abstract={Even though different optical techniques have been applied on ‘Spray A’ in-flame soot quantification within Engine Combustion Network in recent years, little information can be found for soot temperature measurement. In this study, a combined extinction and radiation methodology has been developed with different wavelengths and applied on quasi-steady Diesel flame to obtain the soot amount and temperature distribution simultaneously by considering self-absorption issues. All the measurements were conducted in a constant pressure combustion chamber. The fuel as well as the operating conditions and the injector used were chosen following the guidelines of the Engine Combustion Network. Uncertainty caused by wavelength selection was evaluated. Additionally, temperature-equivalence ratio maps were constructed by combining the measurements with a 1D spray model. Temperature fields during the quasi-steady combustion phase show peak temperatures around the limit of the radiation field, in agreement with a typical diffusion flame structure. Effects of different operating parameters on soot formation and temperature were investigated. Soot temperature increases dramatically with oxygen concentration, but it shows much less sensitivity with ambient temperature and injection pressure, which on the other hand have significant effects on soot production. © 2019 The Combustion Institute},

abstract={Our knowledge of active magmatic hydrothermal system (or magmatic vapors) is largely related to the modeling of geochemical processes including heterogeneous equilibrium calculations with variable bulk composition, temperature or pressure. With the aim to constrain the characteristics of extinct hydrothermal systems it is necessary to look for petrogenic evidence in active ones. The Kudryavy volcano in the Kurile Islands (Russia) provides a unique natural laboratory to study the formation of fumarolic rocks from high temperature fluids (measured temperature for the fumaroles up to 940 °C). By studying the minerals chemistry and assemblages and by computing a thermodynamical modeling, we investigated the mineralogical evidence for such high-temperature. We confirm the documented occurrence of Ca-Fe rich minerals as isolated patches, veins or incrustation in cavities and their formation during the alteration of primary minerals. We describe and documented secondary Na-Al rich minerals (davyne, nepheline, sodalite) and their occurrence together with Ca-Fe minerals in cavities. We also documented the presence of Fe-wollastonite, a relatively rare mineral suggesting high-T formation and we observed assemblages including wollastonite + andradite + magnetite suggesting high-temperature decomposition of andradite. This natural laboratory provides a series of concordant petrologic evidences for high-temperature fumarolic rocks and offers guidelines for the study of ancient high temperature hydrothermal environments on Earth and other planets like Mars. © 2019},

abstract={A longstanding question in ecology concerns the prediction of the fate of mountain species under climate change, where climatic and geomorphic factors but also endogenous species characteristics are jointly expected to control species distributions. A significant step forward would single out reliably landscape effects, given their constraining role and relative ease of theoretical manipulation. Here, we address population dynamics in ecosystems where the substrates for ecological interactions are mountain landscapes subject to climate warming. We use a minimalist model of metapopulation dynamics based on virtual species (i.e. a suitable assemblage of focus species) where dispersal processes interact with the spatial structure of the landscape. Climate warming is subsumed by an upward shift of species habitat altering the metapopulation capacity of the landscape and hence species viability. We find that the landscape structure is a powerful determinant of species survival, owing to the specific role of the predictably evolving connectivity of the various habitats. Range shifts and lags in tracking suitable habitat experienced by virtual species under warming conditions are singled out in different landscapes. The range of parameters is identified for which these virtual species (characterized by comparable viability thus restricting their possible fitnesses and niche widths) prove unable to cope with environmental change. The statistics of the proportion of species bound to survive is identified for each landscape, providing the temporal evolution of species range shifts and the related expected occupation patterns. A baseline dynamic model for predicting species fates in evolving habitats is thus provided. © 2019 Giezendanner et al.

abstract={Extinction and delayed recovery during the end-Permian extinction and Early Triassic has been linked to environmental instability brought on by volcanic outgassing and greenhouse conditions, but the relative importance of the myriad of environmental stressors at this time on recovery dynamics is not well understood. Previous workers have documented both overall delayed biotic recovery for the entirety of the Early Triassic, but also incipient recoveries that appear to occur relatively early after the initial extinction event. Here, we explore the patterns of extinction and recovery using several metrics of ecological complexity in marine benthic communities using a global dataset, and compare several multiple regression models to determine which set of abiotic factors best predicts extinction and recovery dynamics. We additionally test the importance of temporal scale of analysis in interpretations of recovery dynamics and modeling results, by including analyses at the epoch, stage, and substage scales bracketing the interval of extinction and recovery. We find differences in mode of recovery between the ecological metrics analyzed, with some metrics exhibiting an Early Triassic recovery lag, while others recover continuously or immediately following the initial extinction event. We also find evidence of a global ‘Dienerian minimum’, with overall levels of community complexity significantly lower than earlier Griesbachian communities, suggesting a synchronous disturbance to the progression of recovery at this time. The regression model with δ18Oapatite mean values as the response variable is most often found to be the best-fit model across all time scales analyzed, though proxies of rock record fidelity and paleontological sampling effort become more important in finer timescale analyses, likely due to dwindling sample numbers. Out of the models tested, these results suggest that global ocean temperatures best predict patterns of extinction and recovery across several ecological metrics, and that thermal episodes during the initial extinction event and subsequently in the Early Triassic recovery period significantly suppressed benthic marine community health. © 2017},

abstract={We performed a comprehensive laser absorption/extinction study of temperature and soot volume fraction (SVF) in C 2 H 4 /air premixed sooting flames. Laser-absorption two-line thermometry at 2.5 μm provided a temperature uncertainty of 50 K compared with that of 90 K using conventional thermocouples. Laser extinction of soot at 633 nm was first validated against the previous measurements using laser-induced incandescence. All of the measurements were conducted at four representative C 2 H 4 flame conditions (equivalence ratio Φ = 1.78, 1.95, 2.14, and 2.38). In addition, a CFD (computational fluid dynamics) framework coupling a skeletal mechanism (56 species and 428 reactions) with the Moss-Brookes model was developed for interpreting the experimental data. The current CFD simulations well predicted the temperature and SVF distribution along the centerline of flame. It is of interest to observe that the SVF depends on the Reynolds number of reactants by investigating the SVFs at different heights above the burner for the varied flow rates and equivalence ratios. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},

In this work, the role of water is evaluated by adding water vapor to the fuel side of a steady non-premixed coflow flame. The steady nature of the flame allows temperature profiles and extinction limits to be measured at different conditions of inlet fuel velocities, and with increasing dilution levels up to extinction. Temperatures are measured by thin-filament pyrometry (TFP) using a SiC fiber and a commercial DSLR camera. Results from Ar, N2 or CO2 diluted flames are also reported to compare the effects of water vapor with those of different diluents. Comparisons in terms of temperatures and extinction limits show close correspondence when adding equivalent levels of diluent thermal capacitance. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Strong sexual selection has been reported to both enhance and hinder the adaptive capacity and persistence of populations when exposed to novel environments. Consequently, how sexual selection influences population adaption and persistence under stress remains widely debated. Here, we present two empirical investigations of the fitness consequences of sexual selection on populations of the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella, exposed to stable or gradually increasing temperatures. When faced with increasing temperatures, strong sexual selection was associated with both increased fecundity and offspring survival compared with populations experiencing weak sexual selection, suggesting sexual selection acts to drive adaptive evolution by favouring beneficial alleles. Strong sexual selection did not, however, delay extinction when the temperature became excessively high. By manipulating individuals’ mating opportunities during fitness assays, we were able to assess the effect of multiple mating independently from the effect of population-level sexual selection, and found that polyandry has a positive effect on both fecundity and offspring survival under increasing temperatures in those populations evolving with weak sexual selection. Within stable temperatures, there were some benefits from strong sexual selection but these were not consistent across the entire experiment, possibly reflecting changing costs and benefits of sexual selection under stabilizing and directional selection. These results indicate that sexual selection can provide a buffer against climate change and increase adaptation rates within a continuously changing environment. These positive effects of sexual selection may, however, be too small to protect populations and delay extinction when environmental changes are relatively rapid. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={The Permian–Triassicmass extinction (PTME) had an enormous impact on life in three ways: by substantially reducing diversity, by reshuffling the composition of ecosystems and by expelling life from the tropics following episodes of intense global warming. But was there really an ‘equatorial tetrapod gap’, and how long did it last? Here, we consider both skeletal and footprint data, and find a more complex pattern: (i) tetrapods were distributed both at high and lowlatitudes during this time; (ii) therewas a clear geographic disjunction through the PTME, with tetrapod distribution shifting 10–158 poleward; and (iii) there was a rapid expansion phase across the whole of Pangea following the PTME. These changes are consistent with a model of generalized migration of tetrapods to higher latitudinal, cooler regions, to escape from the superhot equatorial climate in the earliest Triassic, but the effect was shorter in time scale, and not as pronounced as had been proposed. In the recovery phase following the PTME, this episode of forced range expansion also appears to have promoted the emergence and radiation of entirely new groups, such as the archosaurs, including the dinosaurs. © 2018 The Authors.},

abstract={Evaluating the terrestrial climate record provides a critical test of the roles of Chicxulub impact and Deccan Traps volcanism during the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction. Most evidence came from marine records, but our new clumped isotopes data from paleosol carbonates in the Songliao Basin provide a terrestrial climate history from northern China. This reveals there was a pre-impact warming caused by the onset of Deccan Traps volcanism, whereas the following short-term cooling then another warming episode were likely caused by Chicxulub impact and post-boundary volcanism. Our study suggests that the pCO2 levels were probably the main control on the latest Cretaceous cooling and the climatic fluctuations across the K-Pg boundary interval in northern China. In the Songliao Basin, the pre-impact Deccan Traps volcanism links to losses of half of the lacustrine algae species (charophytes) and almost all of the lacustrine ostracodes; this suggests that the Deccan Traps volcanism had already destabilized the ecosystem and caused extinctions prior to the Chicxulub impact. © 2018 Geological Society of America.},

abstract={It is firmly demonstrated in experiment that the self-absorption (SA) effect can lead to the extinction of the zero-phonon line and the first-order longitudinal optical phonon sideband of free excitonic luminescence of ZnO at room temperature. Moreover, effectiveness degree of SA effect is found to be dependent on both absorption coefficient and travelling distance of emitted photons, as well as even lattice temperature, which is uniquely reflected by the redshift amount in emission peak in ZnO. It is also unambiguously proved that the SA effect still strictly obeys the Beer-Lambert law of absorption. This work not only uncovers the long-term puzzle of significant redshift of emission peak of ZnO at higher temperatures, but also shows that the SA effect may have to be carefully taken into consideration in the study of spontaneous emission, laser and relevant optoelectronic processes in luminescent materials and optoelectronic devices. © 2017 Science China Press},

abstract={Recognising that species interact across a range of spatial scales, we explore how landscape structure interacts with temperature to influence persistence. Specifically, we recognise that few studies indicate thermal shifts as the proximal cause of species extinctions; rather, species interactions exacerbated by temperature result in extinctions. Using microcosm-based experiments, as models of larger landscape processes, we test hypotheses that would be problematic to address through field work. A text-book predator–prey system (the ciliates Didinium and Paramecium) was used to compare three landscapes: an unfragmented landscape subjected to uniform temperatures (10, 20, 30°C); a fragmented landscape (potentially hosting metapopulations) subjected to these three temperatures; and a fragmented landscape subjected to a spatial temperature gradient (∼ 10 to 30°C) – despite the prevalence of natural temperature ecoclines this is the first time such an analysis has been conducted. Initial thermal response-analysis (growth, mortality, and movement measured between 10 and 30°C) suggested that as temperature increased, the predator might drive the prey to extinction. Thermal preferences (measured at 5 temperatures between 10 and 30°C), indicated that both predator and prey preferred warmer temperatures, with the predator exhibiting the stronger preference, suggesting that cooler regions might act as a prey-refuge. The landscape level observations, however, did not entirely support the predictions. First, in the unfragmented landscape, increased temperature led to extinctions, but at the highest temperature (where the predator growth can be reduced) the prey survived. Second, at high temperatures the fragmented landscape failed to host metapopulations that would allow predator–prey persistence. Third, the thermal ecocline did not provide heterogeneity that improved stability; rather it forced both species to occupy a smaller realized space, leading toward extinctions. These findings reveal that temperature-impacted rates and temperature preferences combine to drive predator–prey dynamics and persistence across landscapes. © 2016 The Authors},

The antenna noise temperature of a ground-based microwave radiometer is measured by alternately pointing toward-the-Sun and off-the-Sun while tracking it along its diurnal ecliptic. During clear sky the brightness temperature of the Sun disk emission at K and Ka band and in the unexplored millimeter-wave frequency region at V and W band can be estimated by adopting different techniques. Using a unique dataset collected during 2015 through a ST multifrequency radiometer, the Sun brightness temperature shows a decreasing behavior with frequency with values from about 9000 K at K band down to about 6600 K at W band. In the presence of precipitating clouds the ST technique can also provide an accurate estimate of the atmospheric extinction up to about 32 dB at W band with the current radiometric system. Parametric prediction models for retrieving all-weather atmospheric extinction from ground-based microwave radiometers are then tested and their accuracy evaluated. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Using in-house synthesized poly(dodecamethylene terephthalate) (P12T) as a model, periodic extinction-banded spherulites melt-crystallized at high Tcs (100–115 °C) are expounded in terms of growth mechanism. The extinction-banded spherulites wildly differing from the usual blue/orange double ring-banded spherulites are composed of all flat-on discrete single-crystalline lamellae packed like roof shingles (or fish scales) along the circularly curved bands and the lamellae in the extinction bands are flat with a lozenge shape with no continuous twisting at all. For P12T films of more than 10 µm crystallized at Tc = 105–115 °C, no periodic bands were seen, and all spherulites were ringless, where periodic growth precipitation of crystals to extinction does not occur until impingement. Extinction bands in the P12T spherulites with the inter-ring spacing steadily decrease with decreasing film thickness, because for thinner films (submicrons to 2 µm), draining or depletion of available molten species takes place more frequently, leading to bands of smaller inter-ring spacing. The petal-like extinction bands are discussed and analyzed in detail using 3D AFM imaging. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part B: Polym.

abstract={The low-temperature oxidation of hydrocarbon fuels has received increasing attention as advanced engines seek to operate in less conventional combustion regimes. Large n-alkanes are a notable component of many real transportation fuels and possess strong reactivity in this important low-temperature range. These n-alkanes have been studied extensively in various canonical kinetic experiments but seldom in systems with strong coupling between low-temperature chemistry, transport, and heat release. To address this issue, the present study investigates self-sustaining n-alkane cool diffusion flames in a counterflow burner. The extinction limits of both hot diffusion flames and cool diffusion flames are measured at atmospheric pressure for a range of n-alkanes from n-heptane to n-tetradecane. It is observed that while these fuels behave similarly for hot flames, the larger n-alkanes are substantially more reactive in the low-temperature cool flame regime. Moreover, ozone addition strongly enhances the low-temperature chemistry to the point where the differences in fuel reactivity are nearly suppressed. The experimental measurements are compared with numerical simulations employing both detailed and reduced chemical kinetic models of various sizes. Although the different kinetic models adequately predict the extinction limits of the hot flames, a large scatter is present in the model results for cool flames, and a general overprediction of the measured cool flame extinction limit is observed for all of the fuels studied. This implies that the cool flame heat release is not well agreed upon by the current chemical kinetic models, despite their capability to reproduce many homogeneous reactor experiments at low temperatures. Furthermore, it is observed that the cool flame heat release is spread over a substantial number of reactions involving large molecules, a trait that makes it particularly difficult to create reduced kinetic models that can accurately describe cool flame behavior. The results of this study suggest that the cool flame platform can provide crucial validation of the coupling between chemistry, transport, and heat release in flames at low temperatures. © 2017 The Combustion Institute},

The squared critical diameter linearly increased with the mole fraction of oxygen in the atmosphere. While no significant differences in the critical diameters were observed for n-heptane and n-decane ithe inert species in the gaseous atmosphere played a major role promoting or inhibiting the tendency to radiative extinction. Predictions and experimental measurements showed good agreement showing that only droplets with an initial diameter larger than a critical diameter undergo radiative extinction.},

abstract={The concentrations of CO2 and H2O in the combustion environment are important for the combustion characteristics of oxygen-enriched flames using hot oxidizers with large amount of CO2 and/or H2O. To understand the variations of flame temperature and stretch extinction limit of oxygen-enriched flames with H2O and CO2 concentrations, the CH4/CO2 versus O2/H2O/CO2 and O2/H2O counterflow non-premixed flames with the oxygen mole fraction of 0.35 were investigated numerically and compared with those of the CH4/CO2 versus O2/CO2 (XO2 = 0.35) flames at the oxidizer temperatures of 500, 700 and 1000 K. Two O2/H2O/CO2 mixtures with different H2O and CO2 concentrations were used as the oxidizers in the study. The results show that the flame temperature and the extinction strain rate are increased when the CO2 in the oxidizer has been replaced by H2O. The analysis based on the theoretical solution and computational result suggests that the total amount of OH radicals of the flame can be used as a criterion for the comparison of stretch extinction limit. The computational results show that the production rate of OH radicals via the reaction O + H2O = 2OH is comparable to that of H + O2 = O + OH when H2O is added in the oxidizer. And the amount of OH radicals generated by O + H2O = 2OH increases with increasing H2O molar fraction of the oxidizer, resulting in a significant increase of the extinction strain rate. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The measurement system for the detection of soot production as high-temperature pyrolysis of hydrocarbon fuels behind the reflected shock wave was established. By using the laser extinction method, the soot yields of toluene/argon mixtures were measured at high temperatures. The mole fractions of toluene were 0.25% and 0.5% while the pressures were approximate 2 and 4 atm. The temperatures ranged from 1 630 to 2 273 K. The dependence of soot yield on the temperature, pressure and fuel concentration was obtained. With the changes of temperature, the soot yield is a Gauss distribution. The soot yield increases as the pressure or fuel concentration increases. The maximum of soot yield was as high as 55%. The peak temperature of soot yield was not changed dramatically with the pressure. However, it changed from 1 852 to 1 921 K as the concentration of toluene increase from 0.25% to 0.5%. Moreover, we compared the soot yield between toluene and methylcyclohexane at pressure of 4 atm with fuel concertation of 0.5%. During the pyrolysis of methylcyclohexane, the peak temperature of soot yield was 2 045 K, which is about 135 K higher than that of toluene. However, the maximum soot yield of methylcyclohexane is only 1/8 of toluene.

abstract={We calculated the uniform dielectric breakdown field strength of residual 30% CF3I/CO2 gas mixtures during the arc extinction process over the temperature range 300-3500 K at 0.1 MPa. The limiting reduced field strengths are decided by a balance of electron generation and loss based on chemical reactions estimated by the electron energy distribution function (EEDF), which employs the Boltzmann equation method with two-term expanding approximation in the steady-state Townsend (SST) condition. During the insulation recovery phase, the hot CF3I/CO2 gas mixtures have maximum dielectric strength at a temperature of about 1500 K. At room temperature 300 K, the electric strength after arc extinction (90.3 Td, 1 Td=10-21 V•m2) is only 38% of the original value before arc (234.9 Td). The adverse insulation recovery ability of CF3I/CO2 gas mixtures in arc extinction hinders its application in electric circuit breakers and other switchgears as an arc quenching and insulating medium.},

abstract={The end of the Permian was a time of great death and massive upheaval in the biosphere, atmosphere and hydrosphere. Over the last decades, many causes have been suggested to be responsible for that catastrophe such as global warming, anoxia and acidification. The Gyanyima limestone block was an open ocean seamount in the southern Neotethys at subtropical latitude, and it affords us insight into open-ocean oceanographic changes during the end of the Permian. After careful screening using multiple tests, we reconstructed carbonate/seawater curves from the geochemical data stored in pristine brachiopod shell archives from the shallow water limestone of the Changhsingian Gyanyima Formation of Tibet. The reconstructed strontium isotope curve and data for the late Changhsingian are relatively invariant about 0.707013, but in the upper part of the succession the values become more radiogenic climaxing at about 0.707244. The 87Sr/86Sr curve and trend are similar to those observed for the Upper Permian succession in northern Italy, but dissimilar (less radiogenic) to whole rock results from Austria, Iran, China and Spitsbergen. The Ce/Ce* anomaly results ranging from 0.310 to 0.577 for the brachiopods and from 0.237 to 0.655 for the coeval whole rock before the event, and of 0.276 for whole rock during the extinction event, suggest normal redox conditions. These Ce* values are typical of normal open-ocean oxic water quality conditions observed in modern and other ancient counterparts. The biota and Ce* information clearly discounts global anoxia as a primary cause for the end-Permian biotic crisis. Carbon isotopes from brachiopod shells and whole rock are relatively invariant for most of the latest Permian interval, which is in stark contrast to the distinct negative carbon isotope excursion observed near and about the event. Estimates of seawater temperature at shallow depth fluctuated from 22.2 to 29.0 °C up to unit 8-2, and then gradually rise from 29.7 °C in unit 8-13 to values exceeding 35 °C at a stratigraphic level about 120 ky before the Permian-Triassic boundary, and just before the onset of the extinction interval. This dramatic increase in seawater temperature has been observed in global successions from tropical to mid latitude and from restricted to open ocean localities (e.g., northern Italy, Iran). The brachiopod archive and its geochemical proxies from Tibet support the paradigm that global warming must have been an important factor of the biotic crisis for the terrestrial and marine faunas and floras of the late Paleozoic world. © 2015 International Association for Gondwana Research.},

abstract={The behavior of different viscous models on the non-premixed swirling diffusion flame and local extinction effect is investigated in this paper. A three dimensional numerical simulation is conducted on Sydney SMH1 flames using Wall-Modeled LES (WMLES) model, Kinetic Energy Transport model and realizable k-ϵ model coupled with laminar flamelet model. The scatter plots of temperature are analyzed when different mixing model constants Cvar are applied. Scalar dissipation rate theory is introduced to explain the influence of the Cvar on the local extinction prediction. The results of the present paper show that model constant Cvar has a significant effect on accuracy of prediction of the turbulent model. Among the three viscous models, the Kinetic Energy Transport model gives the best prediction on local extinction effect at the main recirculation zone.

abstract={The critical thermal maximum (CTmax), the temperature at which motor control is lost in animals, has the potential to determine if species will tolerate global warming. For insects, tolerance to high temperatures decreases with latitude, suggesting that similar patterns may exist along elevational gradients as well. This study explored how CTmax varies among species and populations of a group of diverse tropical insect herbivores, the rolled-leaf beetles, across both broad and narrow elevational gradients. Data from 6,948 field observations and 8,700 museum specimens were used to map the elevational distributions of rolled-leaf beetles on two mountains in Costa Rica. CTmax was determined for 1,252 individual beetles representing all populations across the gradients. Initial morphological identifications suggested a total of 26 species with populations at different elevations displaying contrasting upper thermal limits. However, compared with morphological identifications, DNA barcodes (cytochrome oxidase I) revealed significant cryptic species diversity. DNA barcodes identified 42 species and haplotypes across 11 species complexes. These 42 species displayed much narrower elevational distributions and values of CTmax than the 26 morphologically defined species. In general, species found at middle elevations and on mountaintops are less tolerant to high temperatures than species restricted to lowland habitats. Species with broad elevational distributions display high CTmax throughout their ranges. We found no significant phylogenetic signal in CTmax, geography, or elevational range. The narrow variance in CTmaxvalues for most rolled-leaf beetles, especially high-elevation species, suggests that the risk of extinction of insects may be substantial under some projected rates of global warming. © 2016, National Academy of Sciences.

abstract={Binary nanofluids form a new class of nanofluids made through the simultaneous dispersion of two dissimilar nanoparticles in a base fluid. Two different nanoparticles may behave differently from their constituent components. Given the wide applications of binary nanofluids in a variety of fields, it is important to gain an understanding of the best stability conditions for binary nanofluids. In this work, the effects of such nanofluid properties as pH, surfactant (SHMP) concentration, and ultrasonic time are experimentally investigated on the stability of binary nanofluids. For this purpose, binary nanofluids are prepared using the two-step method. Two dissimilar nanoparticles, i.e. CuO and γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles are dispersed in ethylene glycol and in the ethylene glycol-water mixture to form the desired nanofluids. Results show that at optimal stability conditions, viscosity and absorbency of the nanofluids are minimum and maximum, respectively. Also, the stability optimal parameters of binary nanofluids are found to be different from their corresponding values for each individual nanofluid. The extinction coefficient of the binary nanofluid is found to be approximately equal to the sum of those of the constituent components. Finally, the extinction coefficient of the nanoparticles dispersed in the mixture of ethylene glycol-water is determined to be greater than that of ethylene glycol. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The present study demonstrates the potential of hydrogen (H2)-doped ammonia (NH3) as a carbon-free fuel. The extinction limits, flame temperature and morphology of the counterflow nonpremixed NH3-H2/air flames at elevated temperatures and normal pressure are experimentally determined. Also, the detailed flame structure and the extinction limits are computed using a detailed kinetic mechanism. Results show that the blow-off limits, the concentration of radicals H, OH and O and the maximum flame temperature are enhanced with H2 substitution in NH3/air flames. This supports the potential of H2 as an additive for improving the reactivity and ignition of nonpremixed NH3/air flames and thus the potential of H2-doped NH3 as a carbon-free fuel. Meanwhile, the extinction limits (in terms of the mole fraction of NH3 in the fuel gas) and the maximum flame temperature are reduced with increasing strain rates, indicating that flames can sustain more NH3 at low strain rates. Also, it is observed that the blow-off limits and the maximum flame temperature are enhanced with increasing air temperature. Measured and predicted tendencies of the extinction limits and temperature for various conditions show encouraging agreement, but quantitative discrepancies among the measurements and predictions merit additional consideration in boundary condition modeling and the reaction mechanism. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Aim: The American pika (Ochotona princeps) appears to have experienced climate-mediated upslope range contraction in the Great Basin of North America, but this result has not yet been extended to other portions of the pika's range. Our goals were: first, to determine the environmental parameters that most influence current pika distribution within California; second, to infer whether these constraints explain extirpations that have occurred in California; third, to predict future extirpations; and fourth, to advance methods for assessing the degree to which pikas and other climate-sensitive mammals are threatened by climate change. Location: Historical pika record locations in California, USA, spanning four degrees of latitude and longitude, from Mount Shasta to the southern Sierra Nevada. Methods: We identified 67 precise historical pika record locations and surveyed them exhaustively, over multiple years, to determine whether pika populations persist at those sites. We used an information theoretic approach and logistic regression to model current pika occupancy as a function of 16 environmental variables, tested our best-performing model as a predictor of historical occupancy, and then used our model to predict future pika occupancy given anticipated climate change. Results: Pikas no longer occurred at 10 of 67 (15%) historical sites in California. The best predictors of occupancy were average summer temperature and talus habitat area within a 1-km radius. A logistic model fitted to this relationship correctly predicted current occupancy at 94% of sites and correctly hindcasted past occupancy at 93% of sites, suggesting that the model has strong temporal transferability. Depending on the future climate scenario, our model projects that by 2070 pikas will be extirpated from 39% to 88% of these historical sites in California. Main conclusions: Our simple species distribution model for pikas performs remarkably well for both current and historical periods. Pika distribution appears to be governed primarily by behavioural restrictions mediated by summer temperature and by the configuration of talus habitat available to pikas locally. Pikas, and other montane species in the western USA, may be subjected to above-average exposure to climate change because summer temperature is projected to rise more than annual temperature. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Species that inhabited Europe during the Late Quaternary were impacted by temperature changes and early humans, resulting in the disappearance of half of the European large mammals. However, quantifying the relative importance that each factor had in the extinction risk of species has been challenging, mostly due to the spatio-temporal biases of fossil records, which complicate the calibration of realistic and accurate ecological niche modeling. Here, we overcome this problem by using ecotypes, and not real species, to run our models. We created 40 ecotypes with different temperature requirements (mean temperature from -20 °C to 25 °C and temperature range from 10 °C to 40 °C) and used them to quantify the effect of climate change and human impact. Our results show that cold-adapted ecotypes would have been highly affected by past temperature changes in Europe, whereas temperate and warm-adapted ecotypes would have been positively affected by temperature change. Human impact affected all ecotypes negatively, and temperate ecotypes suffered the greatest impacts. Based on these results, the extinction of cold-adapted species like Mammuthus primigenius may be related to temperature change, while the extinction of temperate species, like Crocuta crocuta, may be related to human impact. Our results suggest that temperature change and human impact affected different ecotypes in distinct ways, and that the interaction of both impacts may have shaped species extinctions in Europe. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={The article provides a method of analytical determination of temperature of ignition and extinction (of critical temperatures of the surrounding gas) and their degeneration depending on diameter of carbon particles. An analysis has been conducted with regard to the influence of the radiation heat transfer in conditions of simultaneous behavior of core heterogeneous reactions of carbon oxidation with the oxygen of gas mixture. It is shown that the point of minimum on the extinction curve and the points of degeneracy delimitate both the area of firing (hysteresis area) and the area of self-ignition of the carbon particle. An analysis has been conducted in respect of the influence which the concentration of oxygen has on the extinction downpoint temperature and on the behavior of degeneration of hysteresis loops at particle temperature dependence on temperature of the gaseous oxidizer and particle temperature dependence on its diameter in conditions when the values of the oxidizing agent concentration and gas temperature are constant. It was determined that the minimum point on the extinction curve and the degeneracy point in the area of large sizes are conditioned with radiation heat loss. In the area of small-sized particles, to the left of the minimum point, decreased diameter of the particles results in degeneration of the critical temperatures of ignition and extinction when the diameter of extinction is reached. An analysis has been made in relation to the influence of the initial critical temperature of particle on the temperature and the diameter of ignition. The limits of variation of the initial temperature of the particle to the extent of temperatures and diameters of ignition and extinction degeneration have been determined.},

abstract={This paper deals with temperature measurements of the surface of tungsten electrodes submitted to electric arcs in nonstationary regimes in air at atmospheric pressure and with the estimation of the power and power density brought by electric arcs to the electrodes. Temperature measurements are proposed for tungsten anodes and cathodes for current intensity of ~30 A and duration of 3 ms. The temperature of the electrode surface at the instant the arc extinguishes is estimated in both electrode polarities. These experimental results are used in a model to estimate the power and the power density brought to the tungsten electrode surface by electric arcs. We found that the power surface density brought by electric arcs to the electrodes was in the range 1.× 109 - 1.5× 109 W/m2 in the case of anodes and in the range 1.3×109 - 1.9× 109 W/m2 in the case of cathodes. It has also been found that reactions of tungsten oxidation had to be considered to explain the high values obtained for the power brought to the electrodes. © 2011-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The end-Permian mass extinction event was the greatest loss of biodiversity ever experienced on the planet. The event is thought to have been triggered by the initiation of the volcanic eruptions of the Siberian Traps. The five million year recovery interval that followed the extinction event was strongly influenced by the environmental effects of sustained volcanic eruptions including extreme temperature events and persistent global and regional oxygen minimum zones. The effects of these environmental perturbations on the paleoecological recovery of the benthic marine fauna were studied in two depositional units from the Southwestern United States representing two substages during the Early Triassic recovery. The Smithian Sinbad Limestone was influenced by high sea surface temperatures and contains a relatively high diversity fauna that exhibits extremely small body size. Gastropods that lived in this environment were size-limited, a possible result of metabolic stress due to extreme temperatures. These microgastropods were able to become dominate components of the benthic fauna by occupying niche space vacated by other taxa that were excluded by high temperatures. The Spathian Virgin Limestone shows evidence for low oxygen conditions. The resulting low diversity benthic fauna had a more ecologically complex community structure than the Smithian Sinbad Limestone including the occupation of epifaunal tiering space by crinoids. As the prevalence of aerobic facies increased through time, diversity, body size, and the complexity of faunal interactions also increased suggesting that low oxygen conditions were the limiting factor for the benthic recovery in that region. The differences in diversity and community structure between the two units highlight the importance of environmental and temporal differences in driving the recovery patterns of the benthic fauna following the extinction event. High temperature events and low oxygen conditions restricted the benthic fauna in different ways but both contributed to the delay in recovery from the end-Permian mass extinction. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={An examination of 2 yr of Cloud-Aerosol Lidar Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) lidar observations and CloudSat cloud radar observations shows that ice clouds at temperatures below about -45°C frequently fall below the CloudSat radar's detection threshold yet are readily detectable by the lidar. The CALIPSO ice water content (IWC) detection threshold is about 0.1 versus 5mg m-3 for CloudSat. This comparison emphasizes the need for developing a lidar-only IWC retrieval method that is reliable for high-altitude ice clouds at these temperatures in this climatically important zone of the upper troposphere. Microphysical measurements from 10 aircraft field programs, spanning latitudes from the Arctic to the tropics and temperatures from -86° to 0°C, are used to develop relationships between the IWC and volume extinction coefficient s in visible wavelengths. Relationships used to derive a radiatively important ice cloud property, the ice effective diameter De, from σ are also developed. Particle size distributions (PSDs) and direct IWC measurements, together with evaluations of the ice particle shapes and comparisons with semidirect extinction measurements, are used in this analysis. Temperature-dependent De(σ) and IWC-σ relationships developed empirically facilitate the retrieval of IWC from lidar-derived σ and De values and for comparison with other IWC observations. This suite of empirically derived relationships can be expressed analytically. These relationships can be used to derive IWC and De from σ and are developed for use in climate models to derive σ from prognosed values of IWC and specified PSD properties. © 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract={The loss of species is known to have significant effects on ecosystem functioning, but only recently has it been recognized that species loss might rival the effects of other forms of environmental change on ecosystem processes. There is a need for experimental studies that explicitly manipulate species richness and environmental factors concurrently to determine their relative impacts on key ecosystem processes such as plant litter decomposition. It is crucial to understand what factors affect the rate of plant litter decomposition and the relative magnitude of such effects because the rate at which plant litter is lost and transformed to other forms of organic and inorganic carbon determines the capacity for carbon storage in ecosystems and the rate at which greenhouse gasses such as carbon dioxide are outgassed. Here we compared how an increase in water temperature of 5uC and loss of detritivorous invertebrate and plant litter species affect decomposition rates in a laboratory experiment simulating stream conditions. Like some prior studies, we found that species identity, rather than species richness per se, is a key driver of decomposition, but additionally we showed that the loss of particular species can equal or exceed temperature change in its impact on decomposition. Our results indicate that the loss of particular species can be as important a driver of decomposition as substantial temperature change, but also that predicting the relative consequences of species loss and other forms of environmental change on decomposition requires knowledge of assemblages and their constituent species' ecology and ecophysiology. © 2014 Boyero et al.},

abstract={Many infectious agents transmitting through a contaminated environment are able to persist in the environment depending on the temperature and sanitation determined rates of their replication and clearance, respectively. There is a need to elucidate the effect of these factors on the infection transmission dynamics in terms of infection outbreaks and extinction while accounting for the random nature of the process. Also, it is important to distinguish between the true and apparent extinction, where the former means pathogen extinction in both the host and the environment while the latter means extinction only in the host population. This study proposes a stochastic-differential equation model as an approximation to a Markov jump process model, using Escherichia coli O157:H7 in cattle as a model system. In the model, the host population infection dynamics are described using the standard susceptible-infected-susceptible framework, and the E. coli O157:H7 population in the environment is represented by an additional variable. The backward Kolmogorov equations that determine the probability distribution and the expectation of the first passage time are provided in a general setting. The outbreak and apparent extinction of infection are investigated by numerically solving the Kolmogorov equations for the probability density function of the associated process and the expectation of the associated stopping time. The results provide insight into E. coli O157:H7 transmission and apparent extinction, and suggest ways for controlling the spread of infection in a cattle herd. Specifically, this study highlights the importance of ambient temperature and sanitation, especially during summer. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The end-Permian mass extinction has been associated with severe global warming. Main stage volcanism of the Siberian Traps occurred at or near the extinction interval and has been proposed as a likely greenhouse catalyst. In this study, a high-resolution δ18O record is established using diagenetically resistant apatite of conodonts and low-Mg calcite of brachiopods from stratigraphically well-constrained Permian-Triassic (P-Tr) boundary successions in northwestern Iran. A new evaluation is made for previously published conodont δ18O values from South China and revised palaeotemperatures are presented together with new data from Wuchiapingian to Griesbachian sections in Iran. δ18O data from P-Tr sections in Iran document tropical sea surface temperatures (SST) of 27-33°C during the Changhsingian with a negative shift in δ18O starting at the extinction horizon, translating into a warming of SSTs to over 35°C. The results are consistent with re-calculated SSTs of the South Chinese sections. Warming was associated with an enhanced hydrological cycle involving increased tropical precipitation and monsoonal activity in the Tethys Sea. Global warming, intensification of the hydrological cycle and associated processes, vertical water column stratification, eutrophication and subsequent local anoxia may all have facilitated an extinction event. © 2013 International Association for Gondwana Research.},

abstract={Extinction limits of counterflow non-premixed flames with normal and high temperature oxidizers were studied experimentally and numerically for development of new-type oxygen-enriched mild combustion furnace. Extinction stretch rates of CH4/CO2 (at 300K) versus O2/CO2 flames at oxygen mole fractions of 0.35 and 0.40 and oxidizer temperatures of 300K, 500K, 700K and 1000K were obtained. Investigation was also conducted for CH4/N2 (at 300K) versus air (O2/N2) flames at the same oxidizer temperatures. An effect of radiative heat loss on stretch extinction limits of oxygen-enriched flames and air flames was investigated by computations with optical thin model (OTM) and adiabatic flame model (ADI). The results show influence of radiative heat loss on stretch extinction limits was not significant in relative high fuel mole fraction regions. The extinction curve of the oxygen-enriched flames with oxygen mole fraction of 0.35 was close to that of the air flames at the oxidizer temperature of 300K. However, the extinction curve of air flames with high temperature oxidizer was comparable with that of oxygen-enriched flames with oxygen mole fraction of 0.40. Scaling analysis based on asymptotic solution of stretch extinction was applied and it was found that stretch extinction limits can be expressed by two terms. The first term is total enthalpy flux of fuel stream based on thermo-physical parameters. The second term is a kinetic term which reflects an effect of the chemical reaction rate on stretch extinction limits. OH radicals which play important roles in chain propagating and main endothermic reactions were used to represent the kinetic term of both oxygen-enriched and air flames. The global rates of OH formation in these two cases were compared to understand the contribution of kinetic term to stretch extinction limits. Variation of extinction curves of oxygen-enriched flames and air flames was well explained by the present scaling analysis. This offers an effective approach to estimate stretch extinction limits of oxygen-enriched flames based on those of air flames at the same oxidizer temperature. © 2013 The Combustion Institute.},

We aim to develop a new family of extinction laws for 30 Doradus, check their general applicability within that region and elsewhere, and apply them to test the feasibility of using optical and NIR photometry to determine the effective temperature of OB stars. Methods. We use spectroscopy and NIR photometry from the VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey and optical photometry from HST/WFC3 of 30 Doradus and we analyze them with the software code CHORIZOS using different assumptions, such as the family of extinction laws. Results. We derive a new family of optical and NIR extinction laws for 30 Doradus and confirm its applicability to extinguished Galactic O-type systems. We conclude that by using the new extinction laws it is possible to measure the effective temperatures of OB stars with moderate uncertainties and only a small bias, at least up to E(4405-5495) ∼ 1.5 mag. © 2014 ESO.},

abstract={The early Toarcian extinction event, once regarded as spanning in the late Pliensbachian-early Toarcian boundary period, actually occurred in two distinct phases in the early Toarcian of the Iberian Range. The first episode occurred in the Mirabile Subzone, Tenuicostatum Zone and is characterised by the disappearance of about 12% of ostracod species and one suborder, the Metacopina (Superfamily Healdioidea). This study shows that this suborder disappears during stratigraphical intervals that are considered to be representative of low oxygen conditions in the Iberian Range. The collapse of marine ecosystems (affecting up to 40% of ostracod species) in the Elegantulum Subzone, Serpentinum Zone was most likely triggered by a sudden and widespread lethal increase in seawater temperature. These combined processes of oxygenation and temperature change are considered to be responsible for the profound changes in marine environments that resulted in the early Toarcian ostracod extinction in the Iberian Range. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The airflow in the trachea of the model is evoked by changing the volume of the air sacs based on the measured tidal volume and inspiratory/expiratory times for the domestic fowl. We compare flow parameters and heat transfer results with in vivo data and with our previously reported results for a two-dimensional model. The total respiratory heat loss corresponds to about 13-19% of the starvation metabolic rate of domestic fowl. The present study can lend insight into a possible thermoregulatory function in species with long necks and/or a very long trachea, as found in swans and birds of paradise. Assuming the structure of the sauropod dinosaur respiratory system was close to avian, the simulation of the respiratory temperature control (using convective and evaporative cooling) in the extensively experimentally studied domestic fowl may also help in making simulations of respiratory heat control in these extinct animals. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The Department of Meteorology at Stockholm University operates the Esrange Rayleigh/Raman lidar at Es-range (68° N, 21° E) near the Swedish city of Kiruna. This paper describes the design and first measurements of the new pure rotational-Raman channel of the Esrange lidar. The Es-range lidar uses a pulsed Nd:YAG solid-state laser operating at 532 nm as light source with a repetition rate of 20 Hz and a pulse energy of 350 mJ. The minimum vertical resolution is 150 m and the integration time for one profile is 5000 shots. The newly implemented channel allows for measurements of atmospheric temperature at altitudes below 35 km and is currently optimized for temperature measurements between 180 and 200 K. This corresponds to conditions in the lower Arctic stratosphere during winter. In addition to the temperature measurements, the aerosol extinction coefficient and the aerosol backscatter coefficient at 532 nm can be measured independently. Our filter-based design minimizes the systematic error in the obtained temperature profile to less than 0.51 K. By combining rotational-Raman measurements (5-35 km height) and the integration technique (30-80 km height), the Esrange lidar is now capable of measuring atmospheric temperature profiles from the upper troposphere up to the mesosphere. With the improved setup, the system can be used to validate current lidar-based polar stratospheric cloud classification schemes. The new capability of the instrument measuring temperature and aerosol extinction furthermore enables studies of the thermal structure and variability of the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere. Although several lidars are operated at polar latitudes, there are few instruments that are capable of measuring temperature profiles in the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere, as well as aerosols extinction in the troposphere and lower stratosphere with daylight capability. © Author(s) 2013.},

abstract={Global warming affects ecosystems and species' diversity. The physiology of individual species is highly influenced by changes in temperature. The effects on species communities are less studied; they are virtually unknown when combining effects of pollution and temperature. To assess the effects of temperature and pollution in the soil community, a 2-factorial soil mesocosms multispecies experiment was performed. Three exposure periods (28 d, 61 d, and 84 d) and 4 temperatures (19°C, 23°C, 26°C, and 29°C) were tested, resembling the mean annual values for southern Europe countries and extreme events. The soil used was from a field site, clean, or spiked with Cu (100mg Cu/kg). Results showed clear differences between 29°C treatment and all other temperature treatments, with a decrease in overall abundance of organisms, further potentiated by the increase in exposure time. Folsomia candida was the most abundant species and Enchytraeus crypticus was the most sensitive to Cu toxicity. Differences in species optimum temperatures were adequately covered: 19°C for Hypoaspis aculeifer or 26°C for E. crypticus. The temperature effects were more pronounced the longer the exposure time. Feeding activity decreased with higher temperature and exposure time, following the decrease in invertebrate abundance, whereas for the same conditions the organic matter turnover increased. Hence, negative impacts on ecosystem services because of temperature increase can be expected by changes on soil function and as consequence of biodiversity loss. © 2013 SETAC.},

abstract={The effect of the initial temperature of a porous carbon particle on the characteristics of its combustion and spontaneous extinction is analyzed taking into account Stefan flow and heat loss by radiation. It is shown that in the case of forced ignition (increase in the initial temperature of the particle), the diameter and density of the particle after spontaneous extinction remain virtually unchanged. As a result, the extinguished particles have the same diameter but different density. It is shown that the dependence of particle diameter on stationary temperature can be used to determine the maximum combustion temperature and diameter of the particle during its spontaneous extinction. The effect of oxygen concentration on the region of ignition of a porous carbon particle, determined by the initial diameter and temperature of the particle, is analyzed. Analysis of the diffusion-kinetic relations shows that each of the two main heterogeneous reactions of carbon oxidation make similar contributions to the heat and mass transfer of the particle with the surrounding gas. © 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

It was found that the size-tailored TiO2 hollow spheres demonstrate tunable light scattering over a wide visible-light range. Inspired by the effect of light scattering, we introduced the TiO2 hollow sphere's scattering layer in quantum dot-sensitized solar cells and achieved a current notable 10% improvement of solar-to-electric conversion efficiency, indicating that TiO 2 hollow spheres are potential candidates in optical and optoelectronic devices. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

Experimental and computational methods were used to quantify the equivalence ratio at the lean extinction limit (φext) and the corresponding stagnation surface temperature (Ts). A range of flow rates (57-90cm/s) and corresponding strain rates were considered. The results indicate that the gas-phase methane/air flames are sufficiently strong relative to the heterogeneous chemistry for Ts conditions less than 750K that the platinum does not affect φext. The computational results are in good agreement with the experimentally observed trends and further indicate that higher reactant flow rates (&gt;139cm/s) and levels of dilution (&gt;~10% N2) are required to weaken the gas-phase flame sufficiently for surface reaction to play a positive role on extending the lean flammability limits. © 2010 The Combustion Institute.},

abstract={The stable isotope compositions of biologically precipitated apatite in bone, teeth, and scales are widely used to obtain information on the diet, behavior, and physiology of extinct organisms and to reconstruct past climate. Here we report the application of a new type of geochemical measurement to bioapatite, a "clumpedisotope" paleothermometer, based on the thermodynamically driven preference for 13C and 18O to bond with each other within carbonate ions in the bioapatite crystal lattice. This effect is dependent on temperature but, unlike conventional stable isotope paleothermometers, is independent from the isotopic composition of water from which the mineral formed. We show that the abundance of 13C- 18O bonds in the carbonate component of tooth bioapatite from modern specimens decreases with increasing body temperature of the animal, following a relationship between isotope "clumping" and temperature that is statistically indistinguishable from inorganic calcite. This result is in agreement with a theoretical model of isotopic ordering in carbonate ion groups in apatite and calcite. This thermometer constrains body temperatures of bioapatite-producing organisms with an accuracy of 1-2 °C. Analyses of fossilized tooth enamel of both Pleistocene and Miocene age yielded temperatures within error of those derived from similar modern taxa. Clumped-isotope analysis of bioapatite represents a new approach in the study of the thermophysiology of extinct species, allowing the first direct measurement of their body temperatures. It will also open new avenues in the study of paleoclimate, as the measurement of clumped isotopes in phosphorites and fossils has the potential to reconstruct environmental temperatures.},

abstract={Low-Temperature Combustion (LTC) is becoming a promising technology for simultaneously reducing soot and NOx emissions from diesel engines. LTC regimes are evaluated by the flame lift-off length - the distance from the injector orifice to the location of hydroxyl luminescence closest to the injector in the flame jet. Various works have been dedicated to successful simulations of lifted flames of a diesel jet by use of various combustion modeling approaches. In this work, flame surface density and flamelet concepts were used to model the diesel lift-off length under LTC conditions. Numerical studies have been performed with the ECFM3Z model, n-Heptane and diesel fuels to determine the flame lift-off length and its correlation with soot formation under quiescent conditions. The numerical results showed good agreement with experimental data, which were obtained from an optically accessible constant volume chamber and presented at the Engine Combustion Network (ECN) of Sandia National Laboratories. It was shown that at a certain distance downstream from the injector orifice, stoichiometric scalar dissipation rate matched the extinction scalar dissipation rate. This computed extinction scalar dissipation rate correlated well with the flame lift-off length. For the range of conditions investigated, adequate quantitative agreement was obtained with the experimental measurements of lift-off length under various ambient gas O2 concentrations, ambient gas temperatures, ambient gas densities and fuel injection pressures. The results showed that the computed lift-off length values for most of the conditions lay in a reasonable range within the quasi-steady lift-off length values obtained from experiments. However, at ambient temperatures lower than 1000 K, the lift-off length values were under-predicted by the numerical analysis. This may be due to the use of the droplet evaporation model as it is believed that evaporation has a strong effect on the lift-off length. © 2010 Taylor &amp; Francis.},

abstract={The decadic extinction coefficient of the hydrated electron is reported for the absorption maximum from room temperature to 380 °C. The extinction coefficient is established by relating the transient absorption of the hydrated electrons in the presence of a scavenger to the concentration of stable product produced in the same experiment. Scavengers used in this report are SF 6, N2O, and methyl viologen. The room temperature value is established as 22 500 M-1 cm-1, higher by 10-20% than values used over the last several decades. We demonstrate how previous workers arrived at a low value by incorrect choice of a radiolysis yield value. With this revision, the integrated oscillator strength, corrected by refractive index, is definitely (ca. 10%) larger than unity. This result is fully consistent with EPR and resonance Raman results which indicate mixing of the hydrated electron wave function with solvent electronic orbitals. Oscillator strength appears to be conserved vs temperature. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

The electrical conductivity at temperatures below 10 000 K proved to increase gradually with the admixture amount of CF3I. The thermal conductivity, in particular around 7000 K, was found to have marked dependence on the CF3I concentration. The result for the decay process of the residual-arc conductance under the free transient-recovery-voltage situation showed that the arc conductance attenuated more rapidly for CO2 mixed with CF 3I at concentrations above 0.9 than for pure CO2.

abstract={The Early Toarcian mass extinction marks one of the critical events in the history of the Earth. Many of these events have been linked to important climate changes. Two sections of the Toarcian showing high-resolution ammonite-based biostratigraphy are studied in Central and Northern Spain. Stable isotope datasets, based on the analysis of 192 diagenetically screened belemnite calcite and 41 bulk carbonates, allowed the construction of δ13C curves and a δ18O-based palaeotemperature. Comparison of the extinction pattern with other sections in Europe and northern Africa shows that the Early Toarcian mass extinction boundary occurred at the Tenuicostatum-Serpentinum transition, and that the organic-rich facies linked to the Oceanic Anoxic Event and the associated negative δ13C excursion are diachronous. From a latest Pliensbachian cooling interval, a first increment of seawater temperature averaging about 4.5 °C, started around the Pliensbachian-Toarcian boundary and developed during the earliest Toarcian Tenuicostatum Biochron, marking the beginning of the main extinction interval. From the Tenuicostatum-Serpentinum transition up to the Bifrons Biochron, a rise in seawater temperature averaging 5.7 °C to 7.8 °C was recorded. This warming interval, which started rapidly and which seems to be synchronous at least in Western Europe, is considered one of the main factors responsible for mass extinction. For some authors this rapid warming was probably due to a massive injection of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, but it does not seem to be recorded in belemnite calcite, and the origin of these possible gases is largely debated in the literature. Additional isotope excursions were found in the studied sections in Spain during the Middle and Late Toarcian. A negative δ13Cbel excursion has been recorded at the latest Bifrons Biochron. Above this shift, the Illustris-Vitiosa subzones thermal peak, which represents a 2-3 °C ΔT, could be linked to one of the tectonomagmatic activity peaks recorded in the Karoo Basin. A renewal in the ammonite and brachipod faunas coincident with this climatic change has been recognized in NW Europe and Western Tethys. An interesting thermal peak has also been detected in belemnites of the Insigne Subzone. ΔT is in the order of 3 °C, and in both sections the thermal peak is included into a δ13Cbel negative excursion of about - 1.5‰. Relative synchrony with the new age for the Karoo main magmatic activity (178-180 Ma) indicates that the δ13C negative anomaly and the warming interval could be caused by the release of volcanogenic greenhouse gases. At this short interval, noteworthy changes in the abundance and diversity of the recorded assemblages in several faunal groups of NW Europe and Tethys are observed. The uppermost Levesquei Subzone thermal peak has only been recognized in the deposits of the section located in Central Spain and coincides with a positive δ13C excursion. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The past relationship between global temperature and levels of biological diversity is of increasing concern due to anthropogenic climate warming. However, no consistent link between these variables has yet been demonstrated. We analysed the fossil record for the last 520Myr against estimates of low latitude sea surface temperature for the same period. We found that global biodiversity (the richness of families and genera) is related to temperature and has been relatively low during warm 'greenhouse' phases, while during the same phases extinction and origination rates of taxonomic lineages have been relatively high. These findings are consistent for terrestrial and marine environments and are robust to a number of alternative assumptions and potential biases. Our results provide the first clear evidence that global climate may explain substantial variation in the fossil record in a simple and consistent manner. Our findings may have implications for extinction and biodiversity change under future climate warming. © 2007 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Recently many issues related to automotive engineering, such as the environment and energy problems have gained attention. These social-related issues are giving impetus to the adoption of urgent measures such as alternative fuels and new combustion techniques for the internal combustion engines. In this context, dimethyl ether is thought to be a potential alternative to diesel fuel, as it has lower overall pollutant emissions and better economy. On the other hand, oxygen-enriched combustion has been gaining acceptance as an environmental friendly combustion, because this can reduce soot and NO x emission. The purposes of this paper are to examine the extinction properties of DME flames and the feasibility concerning the application of oxygen-enriched combustion to DME flames using a counterflow burner. Firstly, the strain rate at extinction is measured for dimethyl ether and propane flames as a function of equilibrium flame temperature under the same flame structure. Secondly, the strain rate at extinction is also measured under the condition that the flame structures are changed, but the equilibrium flame temperatures are not varied. In addition, numerical calcula tions are also performed using detailed chemical-kinetic mechanism to obtain value for extinction and compared with measurements.},

abstract={The present work presents a geochemical study, focused on the oxygen and carbon isotopic signatures of shallow-marine, carbonate extinct chimneys, from Jaroso Hydrothermal System (JHS). In each chimney a meticulous sampling from the central orifice to the outer rim of the structure was performed. The isotopic geochemistry study allowed to establish the origin and evolution of the fluids during the formation of the vent structures. The negative δ13C values indicate a source of meteoric water for the Fe-rich fluids. More positive δ13C values are present in ankerite and in some calcite, both related with marine water. δ18O in ankerite indicates low-temperature hydrothermal conditions, while in calcite is showing either primary signatures or early diagenesis at low temperature. On the contrary, calcite displaying more negative δ13C and δ18O values represents a late mineral phase which was formed under meteoric diagenesis. Each chimney resulted from the precipitation of intergranular carbonate cement around a channellized flux of metal-rich fluid crossing a shallow-marine, unconsolidated, sandy-marl substrate. The paleoenvironmental interpretation carried out from the isotopic data emphasizes the importance of the stable isotopes as fluid geomarkers, also advancing in the understanding of an interesting analog for the geological and astrobiological exploration of Mars. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Measurements of temperature in laminar flames with localised extinction points were made using line imaging of spectrally resolved laser Raman scattering through the extinction process. A fit to the nitrogen scattering spectrum was used to determine temperature with an accuracy of ±30 K. Temperature gradients through the extinction process were measured as the flame strength prior to extinction and the rate of extinction was separately controlled. The results were compared to previously reported numerical simulations for this flame and were found to validate the modelling of the flame extinction process. The measured temperature gradient is affected by the radial rate at which strain is increased, as well as inner flame strength. Measurements of integrated flame emission were also made at the extinction point and indicate that reactions persist at temperatures well below the onedimensional extinction temperature, which is consistent with reaction rate profiles from the numerical simulations. © 2007 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

This integration signal gives a good signal to noise ratio when compared with the temperature lidar system which use an interference filter for a single quantum number. From this new system, we can obtain the temperature parameter and aerosol scattering coefficient with good signal to noise ratio the (SNR) with a normal laser and a small telescope up to several kilometers.

abstract={Proper tissue preservation from a wide range of animals of different species is of paramount importance, as these tissue samples could be used to reintroduce lost genes back into the breeding pool by somatic cloning. We aim to study the temporal and thermal post-mortem limits, tested in rabbits and pigs, within which there will be guarantees of obtaining living skin cells in goat, sheep, and cattle. We also intend to study the effect of vitrification on the ability of ear skin cells, stored at different times and temperatures, to attach to the substratum and grow in vitro after warming. Ears were stored either at 4°C for 12, 252, and 348 h post-mortem (hpm), or at room temperature (22-25°C) for 60 and 96 hpm. In all cases, skin samples from these ears were sorted into two groups: one group was in vitro cultured immediately after storage, and the other group was vitrified after storage and further in vitro cultured. In goat and sheep, no differences in attachment (100%: goat; 90-100%: sheep) or subconfluence (75-100%: goat; 70-100%: sheep) rates were observed between experimental groups. However, in days of culture to reach subconfluence, significant differences between non-vitrified and vitrified groups were observed when ears were stored at 4°C for 12 and 252 hpm. In cattle, with respect to attachment rate, vitrified samples from ears stored at 22-25°C for 60 hpm were different from non-vitrified control group (60 vs. 100%, respectively; P < 0.05). Also, days of culture to reach subconfluence were analysed by a non-parametric Cox Survival Analysis. In general, results from ANOVA and Survival Analysis were similar, because the proportion of censored data was quite low (9%), so the bias when using ANOVA is not too high. In spite of all the above, the lowest survival rates (75%: goat; 70%: sheep; and 40%: cattle) were sufficiently high to enable collection of skin samples from the majority of dead animals and their cryopreservation. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Experiments involving elastic backscatter from dense clouds and a solid target confirm the high level of suppression of the elastic light in the corresponding acquisition channels of the two selected PRR domains. Calibration of the temperature channel was done both by comparison with an experimentally verified atmospheric temperature model profile and by inter-comparison with radiosondes.

abstract={The post-mortem temporal and thermal limits within which there will be ample guarantees of rescuing living skin cells from dead specimens of two species, rabbit and pig, were studied. Post-mortem extirpated whole ears were stored (in non-aseptic conditions) either at 4°C or at room temperature (from 22 to 25°C) or at 35°C for different time lapses after animal death. In both species, the post-mortem maximum time lapses where cell viability was not significantly reduced were 240, 72, and 24 h post-mortem (hpm) for 4, 22-25 and 35°C, respectively. Once the post-mortem temporal limits for each tested thermal level at which cells from skin samples are able to grow in culture were defined, the survival ability of skin samples submitted to these temporal limits and cryopreserved were tested. In the pig, skin samples stored at the three tested thermal levels survived after vitrification-warming, reaching confluence in culture. In rabbit, only tissue samples from ears stored at 35°C for 24 hpm did not survive after vitrification-warming. In conclusion, we should remark that cell survival rates obtained according to the assayed post-mortem time lapses and thermal levels are sufficient to collect and to cryopreserve skin samples from the majority of dead specimens. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract={The lidar of the Radio Science Center for Space and Atmosphere (RASC; Kyoto, Japan) makes use of two pure rotational Raman (RR) signals for both the measurement of the atmospheric temperature profile and the derivation of a temperature-independent Raman reference signal. The latter technique is new and leads to significantly smaller measurement uncertainties compared with the commonly used vibrational Raman lidar technique. For the measurement of temperature, particle extinction coefficient, particle backscatter coefficient, and humidity simultaneously, only four lidar signals are needed: the elastic Cabannes backscatter signal, two RR signals, and the vibrational Raman water vapor signal. The RASC lidar provides RR signals of unprecedented intensity. Although only 25% of the RR signal intensities can be used with the present data-acquisition electronics, the 1-s statistical uncertainty of nighttime temperature measurements is lower than for previous systems and is 1K up to 11-km height for, e.g., a resolution of 500 m and 9 min. In addition, RR measurements in daytime also have become feasible. © 2002 Optical Society of America.},

abstract={The extinction limits of methane-air diffusion flames in preheated air are studied experimentally and theoretically. The air temperature is varied in the wide range from ambient temperature (285 K) to as high as 1500 K. The fuel employed is methane with initial temperature of 300 K. Fuel or air diluted with Ar, N2, or CO2. For all conditions studied here, it is found that extinction of the diffusion flame occurs up to 1500 K, which is significantly above the auto-ignition temperature. The experimental results can be well reproduced in terms of pre-exponential factor and activation temperature of a hypothetical one-step overall reaction as determined by application of activation energy asymptotics.},

abstract={Emission spectroscopy and the recording of electrical characteristics are used to study the influence of the granulometric composition of arc-quenching material. Six adjacent intervals of grain size are studied: each of them is 50 μm wide, and the upper limit of the global interval is lower than 1000 μm. The final dimensions of the fulgurite are found to be proportional to the granulometry. Concerning the electrical parameters, two groups are considered: the extinction time constant, the dissipated energy and the I2t value decrease with the granulometry, whereas the maximum value of the arc voltage increases with the granulometry. The rate of decrease of the temperature depends on the time interval observed: at the beginning of the arcing period, the decrease is fastest for the smallest granulometric parameters; and during the last part of the arcing period the trend is reversed. At the beginning of the arcing period, the electron number density increase varies between 1019 and 1020 cm-3 ms-1. When the electric current decreases, the electron number density decreases exponentially with a time constant value ranging from 0.40 ms to 0.25 ms.},

abstract={Protracted high sea temperature anomalies accompanying El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events have caused reef-building coral bleaching (loss of zooxanthellae) and mortality in all major coral reef biogeographic regions during the past two decades. Coral reef degradation in the eastern tropical Pacific has resulted from reductions in live coral cover, declines in coral species population abundances, local to regional scale extinctions, disruption of predator/prey spatial relations and relative abundances, bioerosion of reef frameworks, and low coral recruitment. None of the coral species that have suffered regional extinctions has reappeared after 15 years. Intense external and internal bioerosion by fishes, echinoids, lithophagine bivalves and clionid sponges has occurred on reefs affected by the 1982/83 El Nino coral bleaching event, and 1000-5000 year old reef frame-work accumulations in the Galapagos Islands have been completely eroded and reduced to gravel and sand. Because tropical zooxanthellate reef species are more vulnerable to rising (2-3°C) than falling (8-10°C) temperatures, greenhouse conditions may be more critical in limiting reef growth than icehouse conditions. ENSO warming episodes elicit physiological stress responses resulting in widespread mass coral mortality, leaving scant traces relating to causation. Signals that may help to identify past ENSO disturbances are: (a) temperature-related oxygen isotopic signatures, (b) skeletal stress bands and growth discontinuities, (c) coral debris in beach storm deposits, (d) increases in coral clastics resulting from intensified bioerosion and (e) the skeletal elements of bioeroders. Because this disturbance is the most pronounced and widespread of any known natural perturbation, and may increase markedly in scope with projected global warming predictions, it is considered a likely agent of future and possibly some ancient bioevents.},

abstract={We have observed the planetary nebula NGC 2440 in the transitions [O II] λ3727, He II λ4686, [O III] λλ(4363 + 5007), H I λλ(4861 + 6563), He I λ5876, [N II] λ6584, [S II] λλ(6717 + 6731), and [S III] λ9061, as well as in various continuum filters. As a result, we are able to evaluate the excitation structure of the source and determine the projected variations in density, extinction, and temperature. Density is found to have a bilobal structure at the nucleus, where peak values approach 2 × 103 cm-3, and thereafter decline to ∼500 cm-3 for distances ∼±12″ from the central star. Densities for larger spatial offsets appear more uniform, although the maps reveal evidence for appreciable small-scale clumping. Electron temperatures appear to vary by no more than ΔTe/Te ∼ 0.035 throughout much of the shell, although here again Te rises by ∼ 14% a little to the southeast of the nucleus, an enhancement which may also extend northwest and southeast along P.A. = 135°. Finally, it is noted that, as in the case of extinction and density, the extinction is prone to small but quite rapid variations over the projected surface of the source by of order ΔAv ∼ ±0.1 mag. There appears to be evidence for a band of extinction with amplitude ΔAv ~∼ 0.2 mag along the minor axis of the exterior bilobal flow and for a possible extinction deficit associated with the interior bilobal flow. We discuss possible scenarios for the formation of this multipolar nebula in the context of the present results.},

abstract={For a species whose abundance is well-known to correlate on the degree of heat different temperature model assumptions may affect the prognosis accuracy of persistence. Likewise, year-to-year autocorrelations in weather fluctuations are known to decrease extinction risk. Thus, we investigated the grey bush cricket Platycleis albopunctata. For this species is known that growth and reproduction is mainly influenced by temperature. We developed a stochastic individual based model for the bush cricket. This day-degree model described the demographic growth of the species that depends on temperature. Daily temperatures were generated by five different methods: (i) temperatures were sequentially taken from a meteorological database. To analyse the influence of different levels of autocorrelation in temperature records (ii) the day-to-day correlations were reduced by randomly permuting the sequence of days within the months of successive years from the database, (iii) year-to-year correlations were reduced by randomly rearranging the sequence of the years held in the database, (iv) combined day-to-day and year-to-year correlations were reduced according to the submodel (ii) and (iii), and finally (v) temperatures were randomly generated on the basis of Gaussian normal distributions. The mean and the variance of these distributions depended on the date of the year. Distributions were derived from the above mentioned meteorological database. We estimated highly different minimum viable population sizes. These did severely depend on the chosen temperature model. Values ranged from 3000 adults to more than a million adults per generation. High amounts of autocorrelation in temperature values decreased the extinction risk of a bush cricket population. Permuting the sequence of the years in the database increased extinction risk less than reducing day-to-day correlations. A decrease in autocorrelation of temperature records can result in unrealistic phenologies of life stages. Decreasing day-to-day or year-to-year autocorrelation in temperature records resulted in an increase or a decrease of the duration of the egg development or the duration of larval development. For poikilothermic species general implications are presented that are relevant for the design of quantitative models used in conservation biology. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={The effect of steam addition on the structure and extinction of hydrogen/air premixed flames is investigated numerically with a detailed kinetic mechanism by adopting both counterflow and stagnation-point flow configurations as model problems. For a specified equivalence ratio of hydrogen/air mixture, the flames in a stagnation-point flow can be maintained to higher steam content compared to those in a counterflow. This can be explained based on the local strain rates defined at the location of maximum heat release rate. The effects of preferential diffusion and reaction incompleteness caused by flame stretch and the effect of steam addition on flame extinction can be successfully quantified by adopting a local equilibrium temperature, which can be determined from chemical equilibrium calculation using the temperature and concentrations of a local mixture in a flow field. The structure of near-stoichiometric flames with the variation in steam content can be successfully explained by introducing a local equivalence ratio.},

abstract={This paper is the second step in the study of deviations from equilibrium in models of decaying SF6 arcs. The first step was based on a kinetic approach, which allowed us to study the influence of deviations from chemical equilibrium. Departures from equilibrium are shown for a simplified geometry, and we find results similar to those of in the literature for the influence of pressure or intensity. In order to build the basis of the two-temperature model, we calculated the two-temperature composition, the transport coefficients and thermodynamic properties, and the energy exchange term between electrons and heavy particles through elastic collisions. Electron-ion collisions contribute to the main part of the energy exchange term, S+ and S2+ having the greatest contributions to this term. Our results show that taking departures from thermal equilibrium into account leads to a slower cooling rate of the plasma. The evolution of temperature departures during extinction is in agreement with experimental results.},

abstract={The generation/extinction phenomenon of a crystal nucleus was studied for 4-dibenzylamino-2-methylbenzaldehyde-1, 1-diphenylhydrazone by using a differential scanning calorimeter at 120-450 K. Glass transition and fusing temperatures were found to be Tg = 306.6 K and Tfus = 422.2 K, respectively, at the heating rate of 2 K min-1. Bulk crystallization, observed in the range 390-400 K, was used to check whether the crystal nucleation did or did not proceed at low temperatures. The effective nucleus which had a radius larger than the critical value at 290 K was generated through annealing the sample for 1 h in the range 120-280 K or for 5 min at 170-270 K. The crystal nucleation process was thus found to proceed even at 120 K, lower by 186 K than the Tg. This is interpreted as indicating that the nucleation rate is controlled by the characteristic time of the β-molecular rearrangement process which could be much shorter than the annealing period. The crystal nucleus generated during the annealing at 220 K for 1 h was found to be extinguished by rapid heating to temperatures above 300 K. This is qualitatively understood from a classical theory.},

abstract={Temperature is one of the most important parameters to be measured in industrial process control. The primary reason for interest in industrial fiber optic temperature sensors is their electromagnetic immunity and electrical passivity. This enables the use of fiber optic sensors in electromagnetically hostile and hazardous environments. During the last decade, many intrinsic optical fiber temperature sensors have been proposed using the Michelson or Mach-Zehnder configuration. However, those interferometers suffer low selectivity and require a well isolated and undisturbed reference arm that is very hard to produce. An alternative to the classic interferometry is a polarimetric sensor which uses the interference of two polarization eigenmodes in high birefringence fibers. We theoretically and experimentally investigated the influences of the sensing and lead fiber length, the extinction ratio of the input polarizer and the coherence properties of the light source for polarimetric temperature measurements. We have shown that there is a possibility to construct a relatively simple and inexpensive fiber optic polarimetric thermometer for absolute temperature measurements by using a low ER polarizer and a low coherent source. The proposed polarimeter does not exhibit high sensitivity However, it is easy to achieve a large unambiguous range with a resolution below 0.1°C, which satisfies most demands in many industrial and medical applications.},

abstract={We have measured the freezing curve of liquid HaSO-t/FhO aerosol droplets having average radii of approximately 0.2 fim. We form the aerosol by the reaction of SO3 with HiO and flow it through a temperaturecontrolled flow tube equipped with reentrant windows, through which we make observations by FTIR extinction spectroscopy. At the freezing point, a microcrystallite of pure ice (HiCKs)) nucleates in the aerosol droplet, and this causes a small change in the spectrum near 3250 cm"1. By recording the temperatures at which the crystallites appear for different acid concentrations, we are able to map out the freezing curve. In the following account, we describe the experimental technique and report the freezing curve for the concentration range up to 35 wt % H2SÜ4, which corresponds to the first eutectic point on the phase diagram of the bulk material. We find that the aerosol supercools by about 35 K below the temperature at which the corresponding bulk material freezes. Our data show that the overall freezing mechanism is similar to that of the bulk solution: after nucleation, the crystallite grows with decreasing temperature, causing the remaining acid to become more concentrated due to the removal of FO until eventually a eutectic mixture forms.},

abstract={About half the Caribbean hermatypic corals died out in the Caribbean during the latest Oligocene through Early Miocene, about 24-16 Ma. The majority of those corals that died out in the Caribbean are extant in the Indo-Pacific, ie they suffered geographic restriction, rather than extinction. The coral and coral associate faunas of three Upper Oligocene and three Middle Miocene fossil reefs in western Puerto Rico were compared. Nearly all coral genera tolerant of both turbidity and cool water survived. Extensive Miocene phosphorites throughout the Caribbean indicate enhanced upwelling in the region during the time of the coral extinction/restriction. Enhanced upwelling could account for the extinction/restriction by generally increasing nutrient levels and cooling Caribbean coastal surface waters. -from Authors},

abstract={Low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) was carried out to deposit tungsten silicide films (WSix) from WF6 and SiH 4 in a low temperature range from 80 to 390°C, using a tubular reactor system. Drastic decrease of the deposition rate occurred at an extinction temperature Tex. Increase of the reactor size in the range from 4 to 22 mmφ decreased Tex from 140 to 80°C. Above Tex, the sticking probability of the film forming species (η) and the film composition, x of WSix, did not depend on the reactor diameter. Dependence of Tex on the reactor diameter and independence of η and x above Tex from the reactor diameter indicates that a radical chain process dominates CVD-WSix process to form film forming species.},

The integrated stratospheric aerosol extinction as well as the aerosol extinction at fixed altitudes in this region showed a significant negative correlation with tropopause temperature. This is attributed to tropospheric convective activity. Though the direct correlation between ambient temperature and aerosol extinction is insignificant at these altitudes, the partial correlation eliminating the influence of tropopause temperature becomes increasingly significant at altitudes far from the tropopause. This indicates the increasing influence of stratospheric microphysical processes at higher altitudes, that is, near the altitude of stratospheric aerosol peak. © 1993.},

abstract={—Climatic change has long been regarded as an important factor in evolutionary history. In particular, periods of enhanced extinction in marine taxa (especially those from warmer waters) have frequently been linked to decreases in seawater temperature. Studies of the physiology of marine invertebrates and fish alive today have revealed well-developed abilities to cope with temperature change, and there would thus appear to be a dichotomy between the rates of temperature change associated with extinction in geological history and the very much faster rates (by several orders of magnitude) with which many marine organisms can cope today. Nevertheless, evidence from ecology and biogeography indicates that temperature, or some temperature-associated factor, does play a significant role in determining the limits to performance, and hence distribution. The resolution of the dichotomy between the evidence from paleontology and physiology may come through a consideration of the role of the previous evolutionary history of the fauna, the influence of sudden temperature events, or the impact of climatic change on individual competitive ability, community structure, and ecosystem functioning. Studies of the energetics of marine invertebrates in relation to temperature and the evolutionary history of polar faunas indicate that we should beware of anthropocentric judgements in attempting to understand the role of climatic change in evolutionary history, and be critical in distinguishing the role of temperature per se from temperature-associated ecological factors. Present evidence suggests that climatic change in the sea, at least at the rates currently believed to be typical, is unlikely to cause extinction by direct physiological impact. It is more likely that extinction is caused by ecological factors; temperature change is thus only one of several factors that may promote those ecological changes that are currently the best candidates for the proximate cause of extinction in the sea. © 1993, Paleontological Society.

abstract={Structures, extinction and ignition limits of strained diffusion flames are examined. The influence of the oxidizer stream temperature is specifically considered. Calculations are performed for diffusion flames formed by a counterflow of diluted hydrogen and air. The air temperature differs from the hydrogen temperature. The reactive flow equations are solved numerically by employing Newton iterations and adaptive continuation techniques. The model includes detailed transport and complex kinetics. Flame structures, extinction and ignition limits and characteristic flame response curves are determined for different values of the fuel-air ratio and for a set of air stream temperatures. It is shown that this last parameter strongly affects the conditions producing extinction. For an air stream temperature of 1000K, the critical extinction strain rate is ten times that found for an air stream at room temperature. It is also found that a temperature exists beyond which combustion always takes place whatever the strain rate. These observations have important implications in turbulent combustion modeling and in the analysis of supersonic combustion. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A turbulent counterflow diffusion flame of natural gas stabilized between two opposed jets discharging from straight tubes of 25.4 mm diameter fitted with turbulence-promoting perforated plates has been examined in terms of its appearance, extinction limits, and mean and fluctuating temperatures as measured by numerically compensated fine-wire thermocouples. It was observed that the flame was flat, blue, and located around the symmetry plane, that its appearance did not change with initial premixing of the fuel stream with air, and that a premixed flame could also be stabilized provided the equivalence ratio was smaller than that of the rich flammability limit. The bulk velocity for extinction of the nonpremixed flame increased with tube separation and with initial premixing, but decreased with an increase in turbulent intensity. The extinction data collapsed to a single curve to within 20% if the total strain rate acting on the flame (bulk plus small-scale turbulent) was plotted as a function of the air volume fraction in the fuel stream, implying a critical total strain rate for extinction that depended only on the degree of partial premixing. Partial premixing increased the resistance of the flame to straining, from about 350 s-1 for pure fuel to about 600 s-1 for an air volume fraction of 0.8, consistent with experiments and predictions for laminar counterflow flames and with experimental data from piloted turbulent jet flames. The present results for the total strain rate at extinction provide a quantitative description of the effect of partial premixing on flame stability and can be used to predict the extinction of nonpremixed flames in other geometries. The maximum mean temperature of the flame did not change as extinction was approached and was about 1300 ± 50 K for all flow conditions measured, while the rms fluctuations were about 450 K; this insensitivity is attributed to a low-frequency (as indicated by high-pass filtering the temperature time series) flame motion, which also resulted in broad temperature probability density functions. © 1992.},

abstract={Turritelline gastropods (Mesogastropoda, Turritelline) are common to abundant components in many fossil (Cretaceous, Cenozoic) and Recent marine benthic communities, but the environmental factors affecting their evolution and extinction are poorly understood. This is in large part because today they occur most abundantly in cooler waters associated with upwelling or other high-nutrient conditions, but thermal tolerances and preferences are unclear for extinct turritelline species. Turritellines were diverse and abundant throughout the New World for much of the Cenozoic. Beginning in the early Neogene, through both extinction and range contraction, however, they started to disappear from higher latitudes on both Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North and Central America. The highest rate of extinction took place in the western Atlantic in the Plio-Pleistocene, when almost all turritelline species in this area became extinct. Preliminary comparison of the available stratigraphic record suggests that this paleobiogeographic pattern is not an artefact of the record. This biogeographic shift coincides with a postulated regional mass extinction among all marine mollusks in the western Atlantic at around the same time. Causes for turritelline extinction, however, appear to be more complex than the decline in temperature that is cited most often as the probable cause of the western Atlantic molluskan extinction event. Neogene turritellines in the western Atlantic appear to have been adversely affected by collapse and/or major reorganization of oceanic productivity associated with the formation of the Isthmus of Panama. Nutrients thus may have been more important than temperature change in controlling extinction probability in this group. © 1992.},

abstract={Limiting oxygen index values of single and multilayer Proban CC‐ and Pyrovatex CP‐flame retardant finished cotton fabrics having a variety of area densities were determined as a function of igniter application time and temperatures up to 200°C. Except for the lightweight (140 g m−3) Proban CC‐treated fabrics, LOI, like comparable extinction oxygen index (EOI) values, increased as ignition times were increased from 2 to 10 s. Extrapolation to zero ignition time enabled [LOI]0 values to be determined at each temperature, which, for a given flame retardant, increased linearly with area density of mono‐ and multilayered fabric combinations. Comparison with earlier extinction oxygen index results showed that this [LOI]0 vs. area density dependence had significantly lower correlation than that for [EOI]0. These ṕoor former correlations further substantiated the claims that the EOI concept offers a more effective means of quantifying textile fabric flammability. Analysis of the linear relationships enabled intrinsic limiting oxygen index, L0, and area density‐dependent, L1, terms to be determined. Like conventional LOI values, L0, values also reduce significantly at elevated temperatures. Copyright © 1990 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.},

abstract={Extinction oxygen index (EOI) and the derived value at zero ignition time [EOI]o have been determined for a series of commercial quality flame‐retarded cotton fabrics in the temperature range 20 to 200°C. The flame retardants used were Proban‐CC (Albright and Wilson Ltd.) and Pyrovatex‐CP (Ciba‐Geigy). For all the flame‐retarded cotton fabrics studied, EOI and [EOI]o decreased with increase in temperature. The influence of conditioned area density M at a given temperature can be predicted via the linear relationship (Formula Presented.) Substitution of moisture correted area density data had negligible influence on the calculated values of Eo and E1. The dependence of [EOI]o on area density, E1, has a negative temperature dependence. The similarly temperature dependent term Eo is the “intrinsic oxygen‐index,” which is independent of ignition and area density variables. For a given flame retardant this represents the fabric properties where maximum access of oxygen is possible. In all cases studied, Eo &gt; E1 and so the temperature dependence of [EOI]o is largely determined by Eo. Values obtained for the fractional increase in Eo, with respect to its value at 20°C, with increasing temperature indicate that the temperature sensitivity of the burning behavior of cotton is greater than that of Proban‐CC‐treated cotton, which itself is greater than that of Pyrovatex CP‐treated cotton. It is inferred that effective flame‐retardants should not only function under ambient conditions but also reduce the temperature sensitivity of the inherent fibre‐burning behavior at elevated temperatures.

However, sufficiently long sampling intervals, or more desirably, generalized differencing of the data, can reduce the constraints of contingency enough to allow direct bivariate comparison. Examples analyzing echinoid diversity and marine invertebrate extinction rates as functions of temperature and sea level are given.

abstract={The mechanism of the interaction of CO2 laser radiation with fused silica is determined by the absorption depth of the radiation in the material. The extinction coefficient of a number of high-purity fused silica samples has been measured by the transmission method by fabricating samples 30, um in thickness. Results obtained agree with the latest reported values. In addition, samples were heated by an auxiliary CO2 laser and the extinction coefficient determined as a function of temperature for six CO2 laser lines. No significant difference in the extinction coefficient was observed for samples from different makers of the high-purity silica. Measurements were also conducted on a silica-rich glass Vycor and a significant difference was observed. © 1987, Optical Society of America.},

abstract={The Eocene-Oligocene boundary is widely cited as the 'other' example of a known relationship between mass extinctions and bolide impacts. The stratigraphic ranges of species of Gulf Coast molluscs reveal a stepwise extinction pattern from the late Middle Eocene to the Oligocene with a peak of extinctions at the Middle-Late Eocene boundary. Although several large transgressions and regressions of the Gulf Coast occurred during this interval, there is little or no correlation between the molluscan extinctions and shelf-area reduction. Temperature drops appear to be the primary cause of these extinctions. These conclusions corroborate the relationship between temperature and extinction seen by Stanley. Although the stepped nature of the extinctions argues against the single impact hypothesis as a cause, these extinctions correlate with sediments containing multiple microtektite horizons and stepped extinctions of planktonic foraminifera. These observations are consistent with a multiple impact or comet shower scenario as the ultimate cause of the temperature drops.-from Author},

abstract={The concept of extinguishability as a measure of textile flammability is reviewed. Definition and determination of extinction oxygen index enables a parameter to be defined from which the effects of ignition time and fabric structure may be removed. This so‐called extinction oxygen index (EOI) and the derived value at zero ignition time [EOI]0 more exactly define the burning/nonburning fabric boundary than does the more widely used limiting oxygen index (LOI). This first paper reports the determination of EOI and [EOI]0 values for a series of cotton fabrics in the temperature range 20–200°C. The influence of the various fabric parameters of area density, air permeability, sample thickness, bulk density, and moisture content was investigated. The advantages of using the EOI rather than the LOI concept as a measure of textile flammability is indicated in the discussion of the results of this study with reference to previous work concerned with LOI data for cotton. In particular, the significance that environmental temperature has on EOI and related parameters reported here and previously reported LOI data is discussed in terms of various published models which define the burning/extinction threshold.

The results indicate that distinct changes in the zonal mean aerosol extinction ratio occurred during this stratospheric sudden warming.

abstract={A small increase in extinction distance with increasing temperature has been measured from observations of thickness fringes in the electron microscope. The results are in agreement with simple theory taking into account the usual Debye-Waller factor and thermal expansion effects. For strong low-order reflections the influence of higher-order reflections is of importance. © 1967 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Determinations of association constant, extinction coefficient and total absorption intensity for the system hexamethylbenzene-tetracyanoethylene in 1,2-dichloroethane have been made over a temperature range of 45°. The extinction coefficient of the complex decreases slightly with increasing temperature whilst the total absorption intensity remains constant. The observations are consistent with the postulate that, under the conditions used, a single 1:1 complex species is formed with no significant contributions from isomeric complexes, or from contact charge transfer. © 1967.},

abstract={During a cruise in the southern North Sea and English Channel in 1948 a series of measurements on light penetration was secured. The apparatus used has been described, and methods of handling it discussed. A description of the experiments for determining the transmission curve of the niters used in the photometers, has been included. Of the systematic and random errors to which the photometer measurements were liable the most serious lay in not knowing the precise depth of the sea cell. Extinction coefficients have been determined from the gradients of logarithmic transmission-ratio/depth graphs, and the results tabulated for each station. Temperature gradients were never large, usually of the order of 0·02 degrees per metre, the temperature usually dropping with increased depth, frequently there was no gradient at all. An attempt has been made to correlate Secchi disk readings with extinction coefficients, as far as the data permit. Sea-water samples from ten stations show that generally the salinity is higher in areas of low opacity, the Beachy Head vicinity being the main exception to this. The opacity results show clearer water than might be expected at certain stations (Nos. 6, 7, 8, 10 and 11) in the southern North Sea. © 1949, Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.

An explanation for this phenomenon has been put forward from the point of view of the change of hydration of the solutes at higher temperatures. 3. This increase in the extinction coefficient with temperature partly explains the frequent increase in the quantum yield with temperature.},
