In this paper we estimated the current and future distribution of the narrow endemism of the Cottian Alps Carabus cychroides, one of the most localized ground beetles in Europe. This species was researched within the sites of historical presence and on the mountain ridges connected to them, recording its presence in new limited areas. The distribution of the species was modeled with fine-grained environmental variables with 25Â m-resolution, in order to identify the presence of microrefugia and obtain an estimate as accurate as possible of the expected variation in geographic range. The results underline the faltering conservation status of C. cychroides, which in the most pessimistic greenhouse gas emissions scenario could become extinct at the end of the 21st century. Furthermore, its narrow distribution appears extremely fragmented and connectivity between suitable patches would decline rapidly in the coming decades. For these reasons and according to the IUCN Red List categories and criteria, we suggest that C. cychroides should be considered an endangered species. Implications for insect conservation: The assessment carried out in this study contributes to the distributive and ecological knowledge of one of the most localized ground beetles in Europe. The methodology used to model its distribution constitutes an helpful alternative to the more common use of coarse resolution variables, making possible the identification of potential microrefugia and therefore a more accurate estimation of the size, fragmentation and connectivity of the geographic range of a species that occupies such a small area.

Anthropic climate change has effects at various scales and occurs faster than the adaptation of species to these changes. Protected natural areas have been created to preserve species from the different threats facing them. Sierra La Laguna is a sky island with almost no anthropic pressure given its natural isolation; it is home to several endemic taxa, including Peromyscus truei lagunae and Sorex ornatus lagunae. This study aims to assess the possible impact of climate change on species endemic to a sky island exposed to virtually no local anthropic pressure. The Sierra La Laguna sky island, located in the southern region of the Baja California peninsula, harbors different vegetation types, including an oak-pine forest at the highest elevations and xeric vegetation at lower ones. Ecological niche models were developed under three climate change scenarios contemplating temperature rises of 1.5 Â°C and 4.4 Â°C. There are insufficient localities to make statistically robust models for mammalian species. Therefore, we used plant species typical of the oak-pine forest (Pinus cembroides lagunae, Quercus brandegeei, and Q. devia) and the rodents Peromyscus eva, that thrives in dry deciduous forests, and Chaetodipus rudinoris and C. spinatus, associated with xeric ecosystems. The models show that ecological suitability for the oak species decreases, while it is completely lost for the pine species. On the other hand, P. eva broadens its elevational range, while C. rudinoris and C. spinatus increase their ecological suitability in both area and elevation. The Sierra La Laguna sky island is an area with virtually no regional or local anthropic pressure. Nonetheless, the projections conducted under various climate change scenarios show a loss of up to 100 % of the area of climatic and elevational suitability for species characteristic of the oak-pine forest even with the minimum temperature rise of 1.5 Â°C. These results suggest that, under these conditions, endemic species such as P. t. lagunae and S. o. lagunae will become extinguished despite the absence of local anthropic pressures.

Additionally, members of geographically isolated biotas may face higher risk because they have less opportunity to migrate to suitable climate refugia during environmental disturbances. Here, we investigate how different types of risk intersect in the well-preserved brachiopod fauna of the Appalachian Foreland Basin during the two pulses of the Frasnianâ€“Famennian mass extinction (Late Devonian, ~ 372 Ma). The selectivity of extinction is consistent with climate change (cooling) as a primary kill mechanism in this fauna. Overall, the extinction was mild relative to other regions, despite the many endemic species. However, vulnerable taxa went extinct more rapidly, during the first extinction pulse, such that the second pulse was insignificant. These results suggest that vulnerable taxa in geographically isolated biotas face heightened extinction risk at the initiation of environmental stress, but that taxa in other regions may eventually see elevated extinction risk if environmental stress repeats or intensifies.

Salt marshes are coastal habitats with a key role in food and shelter provisioning, sediment deposition, nutrient cycling and carbon storage. Spartina spp. is a genus of grass halophytes which occurs in salt marshes worldwide, and includes species with different invasive potential. We evaluated the effect of climate change in the distribution and invasion potential of five Spartina species (S. anglica, S. alterniflora, S. densiflora, S. patens, and S. maritima) at a global scale. Species distribution models (SDMs) were applied on species occurrence data and atmospheric environmental predictors (WorldClim 2.1) to project potential changes in habitat suitability and associated changes in distribution and species co-occurrence until the end of the century, across four Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (i.e., SSP1-2.6 to SSP5-8.5). Projections showed a global trend for increasing species co-occurrence, with a general range expansion potentiated by increasing pathway severity. This study suggests that Spartina species can potentially benefit from climate change, predicting poleward expansions in the Northern Hemisphere for most species, with results pointing at increased conflict and invasion potential in Northern Europe and East Asian shorelines, already under strong invasive pressure. S. anglica is projected to remain a successful invader, with more severe scenarios likely favoring greater expansions. S. alterniflora exhibits very low expansion comparatively, despite exhibiting the same northward distribution shift. SSP1-2.6 produced the smallest change to species co-occurrence, suggesting a smaller potential for invasion-related conflicts, although still registering a potential net expansion for the Genus.

Crustaceans from freshwater temporary ponds produce resting eggs to cope with environmental uncertainty and, as a consequence, egg banks have a fundamental role for population persistence. The egg bank dynamics of six clonal lineages of Heterocypris incongruens (Ostracoda) from Northern Italy were simulated. Clonal lineages W1 and W2 are the most common â€œwinter ecotypesâ€, clonal lineages S1 and S2 are allochthonous â€œsummer ecotypesâ€ and clonal lineages I1 and I2 are relatively rare and generalist in terms of seasonality. Fecundity and proportion of resting eggs vary by clonal lineage, temperature and photoperiod. The clonal extinction risk was estimated in present climate conditions and under climate change. For comparison, and to assess the potential colonization of northern ponds, clonal lineages from Lampedusa Island (Southern Italy), L, were considered. Cohenâ€™s general model was used for simulating egg bank dynamics and the extinction rate of each clonal lineage was estimated with uncertainty analysis. A 30 year simulation in present and climate change conditions was carried out. Extinction rates were lower in climate change conditions than in present conditions. Hydroperiod, hatching rate and egg deterioration rate were the critical factors that affected extinction rates. Extinction rates varied among clonal lineages. This suggests that H. incongruens might be able to have multiple responses to climate change due to its genetic diversity. In climate change conditions, W clonal lineages underwent a niche expansion, while a mismatch between photoperiod and hydroperiod might generate a detrimental effect on the phenology of summer S clonal lineages that might cause their extinction. Southern clonal lineages L, showing an intermediate extinction rate, might colonize northern temporary ponds. Â© 2021 by the authors.

However, species extinctions have been documented only rarely because of a lack of reliable floristic data. Here, we assessed species losses of bog complexes and analysed their potential drivers. Location: Black Forest, Germany. Methods: We made use of the unique situation that the majority of bogs in the Black Forest (124 sites) had been systematically surveyed from 1972 to 1980 and resurveyed the flora of the same sites between 2017 and 2020. In addition, we included further data from the preceding decades. Results: Out of 88 species for which we compiled site occupancy data, two species went extinct in the whole study area and 37 decreased from 1972 to 2020, losing on average 33% of their initial frequency. In contrast, 46 species displayed a positive trend. While decreasing species were characteristic of raised bogs, moorland ponds and base-rich mires, increasing species were typical of poor mires, fens and wet meadows. Species losses were higher at low elevation, pointing to increasing temperature increase and decreasing precipitation as main drivers of extinction, while habitat area, distance to the nearest site and land use played no significant role. The mean altitude at which extinctions of populations occurred increased with time. Assuming a continuation of the observed negative trends for declining bog species, our models predict the extinction of further ten species by 2045. Main Conclusion: Our study highlights the value of systematic and comprehensive past biodiversity surveys to assess biodiversity change. We demonstrated that low-mountain habitats have already suffered biodiversity loss as a result of climate change. There are only limited management options against rising temperatures and decreasing precipitation. Â© 2020 The Authors.

This data then formed the basis for the biogeographical regionalization of this complex transitional area using hierarchical clustering and infomap network methods. I used linear models to explore the correlates of extinction risk for this threatened mammalian fauna. Functional grouping of target species was used to assess their vulnerability to the magnitude and velocity of climate change impacts. Both clustering and network methods successfully illuminated the intricate biogeographic patterns, while the network detected many more small bioregions, including two transition zones. The extinction risk analyses revealed that direct human impacts through hunting and persecution played a major role in the decline of these taxa, as opposed to the minor effect of indirect and intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The magnitude and velocity of climate change impacts varied significantly between functional groups, with the highest risk of exposure to extreme climates in large and threatened species occurring in lowlands. This study provides a foundation for future biogeographic, systematics and ecological studies of Iranian mammals while simultaneously adding to the limited available information on the bioregionalization at regional scales. It also highlights the importance of incorporating threats in extinction risk models and functional trait information in climate change impact assessments.

We investigated the current and projected distribution and range changes of Cochemiea halei, an endemic island cactus. This taxon is of conservation concern, currently listed as vulnerable on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List and as a species of special concern under Mexican federal law. The goals of this study are to (a) identify the correlations between climate variables and current suitable habitat for C.Â halei; (b) determine whether the species is a serpentine endemic or has a facultative relationship with ultramafic soils; and (c) predict range changes of the species based on climate change scenarios. Location: The island archipelago in BahÃ­a Magdalena on the Pacific coast, Baja California Sur, Mexico. Methods: We used temperature and precipitation variables at 30-arc second resolution and soil type, employing multiple species distribution modeling methods, to identify important climate and soil conditions driving current habitat suitability. The best model of current suitability is used to predict possible effects of four climate change scenarios based on best-case to worst-case representative concentration pathways, with projected climate data from two general circulation models, over two time periods. Main conclusions: The occurrence of the species is found to be strongly correlated with ultramafic soils. The most important climate predictor for habitat suitability is annual temperature range. The species is predicted to undergo range contractions from 21% to 53%, depending on the severity and duration of exposure to climate change. The broader implications for a wide range of narrowly adapted, threatened, and endemic plant species indicate an urgent need for threat assessment based on habitat suitability and climate change modeling.

However, studies on climate change effects rarely consider endemic species and their niche properties. Using species distribution models, we assessed the impact of climate change on the endemic flora of the richest centre of endemism in the Alps: the South-Western Alps. We projected the potential distributions of 100 taxa under both an optimistic (RCP2.6) and a pessimistic (RCP8.5) climate scenario, analysing the relationships between range dynamics and several predictors (dispersal abilities, vegetation belts, niche marginality, niche breadth, altitudinal range and present range). The negative impact ranged from weak to severe according to the scenario, but the extinction risk was low. The dispersal abilities of species strongly affected these range dynamics. Colline and subalpine species were the most threatened and the relationship between range dynamics and predictors varied among vegetation belts. Our results suggest that the rough topography of the SW Alps will probably buffer the climate change effects on endemics, especially if climate will remain within the limits already experienced by species during the Holocene. The presence of the Mediterranean-mountain flora, less affected by climate change than the alpine one, may explain the lower number of species threatened by extinction in the SW Alps than in other European mountains.

However, there are few long-term studies on species with conservation issues and restricted distributions. Huemul is a deer endemic to the southern Andes in South America and it is considered endangered mostly due to a 50% reduction of its distribution over the last 500Â years. To assess environmental variables potentially affecting huemul population viability and the impact of climate change, we developed population dynamics models. We used a 14-year survey data from Bernardo Oâ€™Higgins National Park, coastal Chilean Patagonia. We used Ricker models considering winter and spring temperatures and precipitation as variables influencing huemul population dynamics. We used the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to select models with the greatest predictive power. The two best models (Î”BIC &lt; 2) included winter temperature and density-dependence population growth drivers. The best model considered a lateral effect, where winter temperature influences carrying capacity and the second best a vertical effect with winter temperature influencing Rmax and carrying capacity. Population viability was evaluated using those models, projecting them over a 100-year period: (a) under current conditions and (b) under conditions estimated by Global Climate Models for 2050 and 2070. The extinction risk and quasi-extinction were estimated for this population considering two critical huemul abundance levels (15 and 30 individuals) for persistence. The population is currently in a quasi-extinction process, with extinction probabilities increasing with climate change. These results are crucial for conservation of species like huemul that have low densities and are threatened by climate change.

One can expect species fight against these forces to get rid of extinction, i.e., species tend to adapt genetically or move to a new environment to resilience against extinction. In this paper, this problem is focused theoretically by considering a coupled of the oxygen-plankton model where planktonsâ€™ habitat changes and beachhead as a response to climate change. Hence, the dynamics of the oxygen-plankton model is considered assuming the spatial gradient of the growth rate of oxygen, in concern with altered sea surface temperature. It is observed that there exists a relationship between the slope of the gradient and the beachhead at which the oxygen-plankton system can stably survive, which can be defined by a simple function that separates the areas of extinction and persistence. Findings reveal that environmental gradient is an alternative way for species to create a new habitat and sustain the species persistence. Therefore, in this paper, it is shown that, in theory, the recovery of plankton extinction and oxygen depletion under climate change can be achieved by adding a spatial gradient.

The near lack of an early and mid-Cenozoic fossil record on Madagascar has inhibited direct testing of any such hypotheses. We compare the terrestrial vertebrate fauna of Madagascar in the Holocene to that of early Cenozoic continental Africa to shed light on the probability of a major mid-Cenozoic lemur extinction event, followed by an ""adaptive radiation""or recovery. We also use multiple analytic approaches to test competing models of lemur diversification and the null hypothesis that no unusual mid-Cenozoic extinction of lemurs occurred. Results: Comparisons of the terrestrial vertebrate faunas of the early Cenozoic on continental Africa and Holocene on Madagascar support the inference that Madagascar suffered a major mid-Cenozoic extinction event. Evolutionary modeling offers some corroboration, although the level of support varies by phylogeny and model used. Using the lemur phylogeny and divergence dates generated by Kistler and colleagues, RPANDA and TESS offer moderate support for the occurrence of unusual extinction at or near the Eocene-Oligocene (E-O) boundary (34 Ma). TreePar, operating under the condition of obligate mass extinction, found peak diversification at 31 Ma, and low probability of survival of prior lineages. Extinction at the E-O boundary received greater support than other candidate extinctions or the null hypothesis of no major extinction. Using the lemur phylogeny and divergence dates generated by Herrera & DÃ valos, evidence for large-scale extinction diminishes and its most likely timing shifts to before 40 Ma, which fails to conform to global expectations. Conclusions: While support for large-scale mid-Cenozoic lemur extinction on Madagascar based on phylogenetic modeling is inconclusive, the African fossil record does provide indirect support. Furthermore, a major extinction and recovery of lemuriforms during the Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT) would coincide with other major vertebrate extinctions in North America, Europe, and Africa. It would suggest that Madagascar's lemurs were impacted by the climate shift from ""greenhouse""to ""ice-house""conditions that occurred at that time. This could, in turn, help to explain some of the peculiar characteristics of the lemuriform clade.

Here I present a spatially resolved numerical hominin dispersal model (HDM) with empirically constrained key parameters that simulates the migration and interaction of Anatomically Modern Humans and Neanderthals in the rapidly varying climatic environment of the last ice age. The model simulations document that rapid temperature and vegetation changes associated with Dansgaard-Oeschger events were not major drivers of global Neanderthal extinction between 50 and 35 thousand years ago, but played important roles regionally, in particular over northern Europe. According to a series of parameter sensitivity experiments conducted with the HDM, a realistic extinction of the Neanderthal population can only be simulated when Homo sapiens is chosen to be considerably more effective in exploiting scarce glacial food resources as compared to Neanderthals.

A recent study on green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) at the northern Great Barrier Reef (GBR) showed a highly female-skewed sex ratio with almost all juvenile turtles being female. This shortage of males might eventually cause population extinction, unless rapid evolutionary rescue, migration, range shifts, or conservation efforts ensure a sufficient number of males. We built a stochastic individual-based model inspired by C. mydas but potentially transferrable to other species with TSD. Pivotal temperature, nest depth, and shading were evolvable traits. Additionally, we considered the effect of crossbreeding between northern and southern GBR, nest site philopatry, and conservation efforts. Among the evolvable traits, nest depth was the most likely to rescue the population, but even here the warmer climate change scenarios led to extinction. We expected turtles to choose colder beaches under rising temperatures, but surprisingly, nest site philopatry did not improve persistence. Conservation efforts promoted population survival and did not preclude trait evolution. Although extra information is needed to make reliable predictions for the fate of green sea turtles, our results illustrate how evolution can shape the fate of long lived, vulnerable species in the face of climate change.

Proxies of past conditions recovered from Stalagmite ANJ94-2 include ratios of carbon and oxygen stable isotopes (Î´13C and Î´18O), mineralogy (calcite and aragonite), layer-bounding surfaces, layer-specific width, and detrital material. Those proxies suggest that the natural environment changed in response to changes in rainfall at time scales of a few decades to multiple centuries; comparison with distant proxies suggests that wetter conditions in northwestern Madagascar may have been linked to cooling in the Northern Hemisphere. Carbon isotope data nonetheless suggest that the greatest environmental change in the area coincided with human introduction of swidden (tavy) agriculture about 1200 years ago, during a time not of drought but perhaps of slightly increasing wetness. The timing and extent of environmental change 1200 to 600 years ago seen in stalagmite and wetland data suggest that human modification of the landscape had a causal role in the extinction of Madagascar's megafauna. On the other hand, the results combine with other recent research to indicate that drought was not the cause of the megafaunal extinction.

Although there has been important work on mechanisms of decline in some species, it generally remains unclear which changes in climate actually cause extinctions, and how many species will likely be lost. Here, we identify the specific changes in climate that are associated with the widespread local extinctions that have already occurred. We then use this information to predict the extent of future biodiversity loss and to identify which processes may forestall extinction. We used data from surveys of 538 plant and animal species over time, 44% of which have already had local extinctions at one or more sites. We found that locations with local extinctions had larger and faster changes in hottest yearly temperatures than those without. Surprisingly, sites with local extinctions had significantly smaller changes in mean annual temperatures, despite the widespread use of mean annual temperatures as proxies for overall climate change. Based on their past rates of dispersal, we estimate that 57â€“70% of these 538 species will not disperse quickly enough to avoid extinction. However, we show that niche shifts appear to be far more important for avoiding extinction than dispersal, although most studies focus only on dispersal. Specifically, considering both dispersal and niche shifts, we project that only 16â€“30% of these 538 species may go extinct by 2070. Overall, our results help identify the specific climatic changes that cause extinction and the processes that may help species to survive. Â© 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

The cumulative impact of climate change on habitat loss is projected to produce disproportionate risk for endemic high-altitude species. The Southern Bald Ibis (Geronticus calvus) is an endemic high-altitude species found throughout highland grassland habitats in South Africa and Lesotho. The historical distribution has contracted notably and causal factors remain ambiguous. Furthermore, the historical population (1950-1970) was believed to be stable, but recent local surveys suggest colony declines and the current global population status remains largely unquantified. We assessed the current distribution and population status of the species through predictive modeling and trends in historical and recent colony counts across the species' range. We examined climate and habitat change as potential causal factors contributing to the historical contraction in distribution, and projected the potential impact of future climate change predicted by global circulation models. Our study confirms that Southern Bald Ibis are of conservation concern. The loss of grasslands to expanding woody vegetation through bush encroachment was the most detrimental habitat transformation type associated with decreased colony growth and colony collapse. We recommend maintaining a minimum threshold of 50% or greater intact grassland habitat surrounding colonies to reduce colony extinction risk and promote colony persistence.

The use of species distribution models (SDMs) to predict habitat suitability, both currently and in the future under the effects of climate change, offers a potential solution for estimating extinction risk. With a set of validated observations, we used SDMs to make preliminary evaluations of the risk of extinction for 114 Egyptian medicinal plants based on IUCN Red-List Criteria and Categories. Using MaxEnt and eleven environmental variables, distributions were projected for 2020, 2050, and 2080 under two emission scenarios (A2a and B2a) assuming unlimited and no dispersal. The IUCN assessments used the predicted distributions as well as the actual records to measure both extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO). There was a positive correlation between EOO estimates based on actual records and those based on SDMs, demonstrating the ability of SDMs to compensate for a lack of data. Most species could be classified as Least Concern (LC) at the current time, whilst in the future under climate change, many species face some risk of extinction, depending on assumptions. We conclude that it is possible to make regional risk assessments even in data-sparse countries, in order to plan conservation management in the future. Using species distribution modelling together with IUCN Red-List assessment is a good method for countries where data are sparse in order to conserve and protect threatened species.

Managers often rely on databases of rare species locations to plan land use actions and conserve at-risk taxa, so it is crucial that the information they contain is accurate and dependable. However, small population sizes, long gaps between surveys, and climate change may be leading to undetected extinctions of many populations. We used repeated survey records for a rare but widespread orchid, Cypripedium fasciculatum (clustered ladyâ€™s slipper), to model population extinction risk based on elevation, population size, and time between observations. Population size and elevation were negatively associated with extinction, while extinction probability increased with time between observations. We interpret population losses at low elevations as a potential signal of climate change impacts. We used this model to estimate the probability of persistence of populations across California and Oregon, and found that 39%-52% of the 2415 populations reported in databases from this region are likely extinct. Managers should be aware that the number of populations of rare species in their databases is potentially an overestimate, and consider resurveying these populations to document their presence and condition, with priority given to older reports of small populations, especially those at low elevations or in other areas with high vulnerability to climate or land cover change.

Periods I and II (9.1-4.9 ka) were wetter and punctuated by a series of prominent droughts. Periods IV-VI (4-0.94 ka) were much drier and less variable. Period III (4.9-4 ka) marks the transition between wetter and drier conditions and consists of two significant droughts: the first (4.8-4.6 ka) coincides approximately with the end of the African Humid Period and the second (43-4.0 ka) may be the expression of the Northern Hemisphere 4.2 ka dry event in northwest Madagascar. Strong positive correlations between delta C-13 and delta O-18 values in Periods I-IV (r = 0.63-0.91) suggest that both isotopes were influenced by natural climate changes indicating that humans may not have been present in the area. In contrast, during Periods V (r = 0.07) and VI (r = -0.12) the ``decoupling{''} of delta C-13 and delta O-18 might signal an impact from human activities starting around 2.5 ka. Rapid changes in climate during the early and middle Holocene, with prominent droughts lasting up to 800 years, did not kill off Madagascar's megafauna, and neither did a human population, present since the early Holocene if evidence from south Madagascar is reliable. However, many extinctions occurred under the more stable climatic conditions of the late Holocene, despite an antiphase climate relationship between northern and southcentral Madagascar. This suggests that initial human colonization, or significant increase in human population, triggered the megafaunal extinctions by hunting and destruction of megafaunal habitats.

Moat2019390,ARTICLE,"Moat, J. and Gole, T.W. and Davis, A.P.",Least concern to endangered: Applying climate change projections profoundly influences the extinction risk assessment for wild Arabica coffee,Global Change Biology,2019,25,2,NA,10.1111/gcb.14341,NA,"Arabica coffee (Coffea arabica) is a key crop in many tropical countries and globally provides an export value of over US$13 billion per year. Wild Arabica coffee is of fundamental importance for the global coffee sector and of direct importance within Ethiopia, as a source of harvestable income and planting stock. Published studies show that climate change is projected to have a substantial negative influence on the current suitable growing areas for indigenous Arabica in Ethiopia and South Sudan. Here we use all available future projections for the species based on multiple general circulation models (GCMs), emission scenarios, and migration scenarios, to predict changes in Extent of Occurrence (EOO), Area of Occupancy (AOO), and population numbers for wild Arabica coffee. Under climate change our results show that population numbers could reduce by 50% or more (with a few models showing over 80%) by 2088. EOO and AOO are projected to decline by around 30% in many cases. Furthermore, present-day models compared to the near future (2038), show a reduction for EOO of over 40% (with a few cases over 50%), although EOO should be treated with caution due to its sensitivity to outlying occurrences. When applying these metrics to extinction risk, we show that the determination of generation length is critical. When applying the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red list of Threatened Species (IUCN Red List) criteria, even with a very conservative generation length of 21Â years, wild Arabica coffee is assessed as Threatened with extinction (placed in the Endangered category) under a broad range of climate change projections, if no interventions are made. Importantly, if we do not include climate change in our assessment, Arabica coffee is assessed as Least Concern (not threatened) when applying the IUCN Red List criteria.

Studies projecting species extinction in tropical regions consider either habitat loss or climate change as drivers of biodiversity loss but rarely evaluate them together. Here, the contribution of these two factors to the extinction risk of narrowly distributed species (with ranges smaller than 10,000 km(2)) of seed plants endemic to a fifth-order watershed in Brazil (microendemics) is assessed. We estimated the Regional Climate Change Index (RCCI) of these watersheds (areas with microendemics) and projected three scenarios of land use up to the year 2100 based on the average annual rates of habitat loss in these watersheds from 2000 to 2014. These scenarios correspond to immediate conservation action (scenario 1), long-term conservation action (scenario 2), and no conservation action (scenario 3). In each scenario, areas with microendemics were classified into four classes: (1) areas with low risk, (2) areas threatened by habitat loss, (3) areas threatened by climate change, and (4) areas threatened by climate change and habitat loss. We found 2,354 microendemic species of seed plants in 776 areas that altogether cover 17.5\% of Brazil. Almost 70\% (1,597) of these species are projected to be under high extinction risk by the end of the century due to habitat loss, climate change, or both, assuming that these areas will not lose habitat in the future due to land use. However, if habitat loss in these areas continues at the prevailing annual rates, the number of threatened species is projected to increase to more than 85\% (2,054). The importance of climate change and habitat loss as drivers of species extinction varies across phytogeographic domains, and this variation requires the adoption of retrospective and prospective conservation strategies that are context specific.

We show that recent warming constitutes an â€œescalator to extinctionâ€ for birds on a remote Peruvian mountainâ€”high-elevation species have declined in both range size and abundance, and several previously common mountaintop residents have disappeared from the local community. Our findings support projections that warming will likely drive widespread extirpations and extinctions of high-elevation taxa in the tropical Andes. Such climate change-driven mountaintop extirpations may be more likely in the tropics, where temperature seems to exert a stronger control on speciesâ€™ range limits than in the temperate zone. In contrast, we show that lowland bird species at our study site are expanding in range size as they shift their upper limits upslope and may thus benefit from climate change.

Yet, the majority of studies investigating the impacts of global change on biodiversity focus on one global change driver and usually use simulations to project biodiversity responses to future conditions. We conduct an empirical test of the relative and combined effects of land-cover and climate change on species occurrence changes. Specifically, we examine whether observed local colonization and extinctions of North American birds between 1981â€“1985 and 2001â€“2005 are correlated with land-cover and climate change and whether bird life history and ecological traits explain interspecific variation in observed occurrence changes. We fit logistic regression models to test the impact of physical land-cover change, changes in net primary productivity, winter precipitation, mean summer temperature, and mean winter temperature on the probability of Ontario breeding bird local colonization and extinction. Models with climate change, land-cover change, and the combination of these two drivers were the top ranked models of local colonization for 30%, 27%, and 29% of species, respectively. Conversely, models with climate change, land-cover change, and the combination of these two drivers were the top ranked models of local extinction for 61%, 7%, and 9% of species, respectively. The quantitative impacts of land-cover and climate change variables also vary among bird species. We then fit linear regression models to test whether the variation in regional colonization and extinction rate could be explained by mean body mass, migratory strategy, and habitat preference of birds. Overall, species traits were weakly correlated with heterogeneity in species occurrence changes. We provide empirical evidence showing that land-cover change, climate change, and the combination of multiple global change drivers can differentially explain observed species local colonization and extinction.

In recent years, the potential for existing and emerging pathogens of agricultural crops to cause increased yield losses as a consequence of changing climatic patterns has raised considerable concern. In contrast, the response of naturally occurring, endemic pathogens to a warming climate has received little attention. Here, we report on the impact of a signature variable of global climate change â€“ increasing temperature â€“ on the long-term epidemiology of a natural hostâ€“pathogen association involving the rust pathogen Triphragmium ulmariae and its host plant Filipendula ulmaria. In a hostâ€“pathogen metapopulation involving approximately 230 host populations growing on an archipelago of islands in the Gulf of Bothnia we assessed changes in host population size and pathogen epidemiological measures over a 25-year period. We show how the incidence of disease and its severity declines over that period and most importantly demonstrate a positive association between a long-term trend of increasing extinction rates in individual pathogen populations of the metapopulation and increasing temperature. Our results are highly suggestive that changing climatic patterns, particularly mean monthly growing season (April-November) temperature, are markedly influencing the epidemiology of plant disease in this hostâ€“pathogen association. Given the important role plant pathogens have in shaping the structure of communities, changes in the epidemiology of pathogens have potentially far-reaching impacts on ecological and evolutionary processes. For these reasons, it is essential to increase understanding of pathogen epidemiology, its response to warming, and to invoke these responses in forecasts for the future.

We evaluated the potential for physiological acclimatization and behavioral avoidance of poor climatic conditions to lower extinction risk under climate change in the global hotspot of salamander diversity, a region currently predicted to lose most of the salamander habitat due to warming. Our approach integrated experimental physiology and behavior into a mechanistic species distribution model to predict extinction risk based on an individualâ€™s capacity to maintain energy balance with and without plasticity. We assessed the sensitivity of extinction risk to body size, behavioral strategies, limitations on energy intake, and physiological acclimatization of water loss and metabolic rate. The field and laboratory experiments indicated that salamanders readily acclimatize water loss rates and metabolic rates in ways that could maintain positive energy balance. Projections with plasticity reduced extinction risk by 72% under climate warming, especially in the core of their range. Further analyses revealed that juveniles might experience the greatest physiological stress under climate warming, but we identified specific physiological adaptations or plastic responses that could minimize the lethal physiological stress imposed on juveniles. We conclude that incorporating plasticity fundamentally alters ecological predictions under climate change by reducing extinction risk in the hotspot of salamander diversity.

In this paper we develop an eco-physiological model of extinction risk under climate change premised on behavioral thermoregulation. Our method downscales operative environmental temperatures, which restrict hours of activity of lizards, hr, for present-day climate (1975) and future climate scenarios (2070). We apply our model using occurrence records of 20 Phrynocephalus lizards (or taxa in species complexes) drawn from literature and museum records. Our analysis is phylogenetically informed, because some clades may be more sensitive to rising temperatures. The limits for computed hr predict local extirpations among Phrynocephalus lizards at continental scales and delineate upper boundaries of thermal niches as defined by Extreme Value Distributions. Under the 8.5 Representative Concentration Pathway scenario, we predict extirpation of 64% of local populations by 2070 across 20 Phrynocephalus species, and 12 are at high risk of total extinction due to thermal limits being exceeded. In tandem with global strategies of lower CO2 emissions, we propose regional strategies for establishing new national parks to protect extinction-prone taxa by preserving high-elevation climate refugia within existing sites of species occurrence. We propose that evolved acclimatization â€” maternal plasticity â€” may ameliorate risk, but is poorly studied. Previous studies revealed that adaptive maternal plasticity by thermoregulating gravid females alter progeny thermal preferences by Â±1 Â°C. We describe plasticity studies for extinction-prone species that could assess whether they might be buffered from climate warming â€” a self-rescue. We discuss an epigenetic framework for studying such maternal-effect evolution.

Garc..a.Vald..s2018906,ARTICLE,"GarcÃ­a-ValdÃ©s, R. and Bugmann, H. and Morin, X.",Climate change-driven extinctions of tree species affect forest functioning more than random extinctions,Diversity and Distributions,2018,24,7,NA,10.1111/ddi.12744,NA,"Aim: Climate change affects forest functioning not only through direct physiological effects such as modifying photosynthesis and growing season lengths, but also through indirect effects on community composition related to species extinctions and colonizations. Such indirect effects remain poorly explored in comparison with the direct ones. Biodiversityâ€“ecosystem functioning (BEF) studies commonly examine the effects of species loss by eliminating species randomly. However, species extinctions caused by climate change will depend on the speciesâ€™ vulnerability to the new environmental conditions, thus occurring in a specific, non-random order. Here, we evaluated whether successive tree species extinctions, according to their vulnerability to climate change, impact forest functions differently than random species losses. Location: Eleven temperate forests across a gradient of climatic conditions in central Europe. Methods: We simulated tree community dynamics with a forest succession model to study the impact of species loss on the communitiesâ€™ aboveground biomass, productivity and temporal stability. Tree species were removed from the local pool (1) randomly, and according to (2) their inability to be recruited under a warmer climate or (3) their increased mortality under drier conditions. Results: Results showed that non-random species loss (i.e., based on their vulnerability to warmer or drier conditions) changed forest functioning at a different rate, and sometimes direction, than random species loss. Furthermore, directed extinctions, unlike random, triggered tipping points along the species loss process where forest functions were strongly impacted. These tipping points occurred after fewer extinctions in forests located in the coldest areas, where ecosystem functioning relies on fewer species. Main conclusions: We showed that the extinction of species in a deterministic and mechanistically motivated order, in this case the species vulnerability to climate change, strengthens the selection effect of diversity on ecosystem functioning. BEF studies exploring the impact of species loss on ecosystem functioning using random extinctions thus possibly underestimate the potential effect of biodiversity loss when driven by a directional force, such as climate change.

Predictions of future climate change suggest large and deleterious effects on species with narrow dispersal abilities due to limited hydrological connectivity. In turn, this creates the potential for population isolation in thermally unsuitable habitats, leading to physiological stress, species declines or possible extirpation. The current extent of many freshwater fish species' spatio-temporal distribution patterns and their sensitivity to thermal impacts from climate change critical information for conservation planning are often unknown. Carmine shiner (Notropis percobromus) is an ecologically important species listed as threatened or imperilled nationally (Canada) and regionally (South Dakota, United States) due to its restricted range and sensitivity to water quality and temperature. This research aimed to determine the current distribution and spatio-temporal variability in projected suitable habitat for Carmine shiner using niche-based modeling approaches (MaxEnt, BIOCLIM, and DOMAIN models). Statistically down scaled, bias-corrected Global Circulation Models (GCMs) data was used to model the distribution of Carmine shiner in central North America for the period of 2041-2060 (2050s). Maximum mean July temperature and temperature variability were the main factors in determining Carmine shiner distribution. Patterns of projected habitat change by the 2050s suggest the spatial extent of the current distribution of Carmine shiner would shift north, with >50\% of the current distribution changing with future projections based on two Representative Concentrations Pathways for CO2 emissions. Whereas the southern extent of the distribution would become unsuitable for Carmine shiner, suitable habitats are predicted to become available further north, if accessible. Importantly, the majority of habitat gains for Carmine shiner would be in areas currently inaccessible due to dispersal limitations, suggesting current populations may face an extinction debt within the next half century. These results provide evidence that Carmine shiner may be highly vulnerable to a warming climate and suggest that management actions - such as assisted migration - may be needed to mitigate impacts from climate change and ensure the long-term persistence of the species.

The population growth of endangered whooping cranes (Grus americana) hinges on juvenile recruitment. Therefore, we identify climatic drivers (solar activity [sunspots] and weather) of whooping crane recruitment throughout the speciesâ€™ life cycle (breeding, migration, wintering). Our method uses a repeated cross-validated absolute shrinkage and selection operator approach to identify drivers of recruitment. We model effects of climate change on those drivers to predict whooping crane population growth given alternative scenarios of climate change and solar activity. Years with fewer sunspots indicated greater recruitment. Increased precipitation during autumn migration signified less recruitment. On the breeding grounds, fewer days below freezing during winter and more precipitation during breeding suggested less recruitment. We predicted whooping crane recruitment and population growth may fall below long-term averages during all solar cycles when atmospheric CO2 concentration increases, as expected, to 500Â ppm by 2050. Species recovery during a typical solar cycle with 500Â ppm may require eight times longer than conditions without climate change and the chance of population decline increases to 31%. Although this whooping crane population is growing and may appear secure, long-term threats imposed by climate change and increased solar activity may jeopardize its persistence. Weather on the breeding grounds likely affects recruitment through hydrological processes and predation risk, whereas precipitation during autumn migration may influence juvenile mortality.

Here we propose a macroecological approach to study LQE that combines niche and demographic models to determine the ecological mechanisms behind the megafauna extinction. Question: Is the overkill hypothesis plausible and realistic when assessing the ecological mechanisms behind LQE? What is the range of population parameters for both human and now-extinct animals that is consistent with the actual extinction pattern? Features of model: Ecological niche models (ENMs) are used to assess climate impact on population viability, whereas density-dependent population models with reciprocal feedback between humans and their prey are used to simulate human hunting pressure. The feasibility of predicted extinction scenarios and explored parameter space is ordered based on a pattern-oriented modelling (POM) approach. We illustrate the usefulness of our framework using the extinct South American ground sloth Megatherium as an example. Methods: We built ENMs by using fossil occurrences records and palaeoclimatic simulations from the last glacial cycle and projected their predictions to the Holocene. Population modelling was based on 4000 random samples of ENM ensembles, from which prey density was estimated using a Gaussian central-peripheral abundance model. For each ensemble, a plausible range of demographic parameters (e.g. growth rate, carrying capacity, mortality of human population, meat consumption) was set across 100 random repetitions, giving 400,000 models simulating Megatherium's extinction dynamics. Results: The macroecological approach highlighted many plausible mechanistic extinction scenarios capable of reproducing a wide range of hypotheses about the LQE. Most models ;(51\%) simulating a vigorous human population with unrealistic growth rates (r(h) > 1.3\% per year) and intense over-exploitation of prey (individual meat-consumption-rate-CI > 100 g per day from one prey only) produced scenarios of rapid extinction as predicted by the overkill hypothesis. However, such overkill scenarios unrealistically predicted earlier extinction times than that observed for Megatherium. Moreover, the high human population growth required to simulate overkill scenarios was attained only recently after the industrial revolution, specifically in the mid-1900s, and it is therefore not applicable for Pleistocene hunter-gatherers. Conversely, although less frequent across simulations, models that correctly predicted the observed extinction time (16\%) revealed plausible and empirically acceptable demographic parameters, encompassing low growth rates (r(h) < 0.70\%) and mortality for the human population (mo < 0.60\%), combined with moderate values of individual meat consumption (CI > 70 g) and geographical range collapse in Megatherium, which is produced by climate change. Conclusions: These findings, based on POM reasoning, highlight that unique mechanisms such as the overkill explanation for LQE, although feasible from model simulations, only occur with implausible parameter combinations and predict unrealistic extinction dynamics.",NA,NA,1937-3791,NA,WOS:000395826400006,NA,1522-0613,NA,NA,"LIMA-RIBEIRO, MATHEUS S./H-9503-2014 Diniz-Filho, JosÃ© Alexandre Felizola/D-9405-2013",97-121,"LIMA-RIBEIRO, MATHEUS S./0000-0002-3322-1702 Diniz-Filho, JosÃ© Alexandre Felizola/0000-0002-0967-9684",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,C:/Users/gmath/Documents/3.PhD/lit_review_past_climate/bibliography/web_of_science.bib,2,"Climate Change, Human Overkill, and the Extinction of Megafauna: a Macroecological Approach Based on Pattern-Oriented Modelling.",selected,NA,selected

Terrestrial fauna inhabiting low-lying islands are likely to suffer the greatest loss to habitat from sea-level rise and other oceanographic impacts stemming from anthropogenic climate change. Bramble Cay (Maizab Kaur), an similar to 4ha, low elevation sand cay located in Torres Strait, Australia, supports the only known population of the endangered Bramble Cay melomys Melomys rubicola Thomas, 1924. As a result of a decline in this population noted during previous monitoring to 2004, habitat loss due to erosion of the cay and direct mortality from storm surges were implicated as major threats to this species. This study aimed to confirm the current conservation status of the species, to seek information about the key factor or factors responsible for the population decline and to recover any remaining individuals for a captive insurance population. Methods During three survey periods (December 2011, March 2014 and August-September 2014), a total of 1170 small mammal trap-nights, 60 camera trap-nights, 5h of nocturnal searches and 5h of diurnal searches were undertaken on Bramble Cay. Key results All three survey periods failed to detect any Bramble Cay melomys. The island had experienced a recent, severe reduction in vegetation, which is the primary food resource for the Bramble Cay melomys. Herbaceous cover on the cay decreased from 2.16ha in 2004 to 0.065ha in March 2014 before recovering somewhat to 0.19ha in August-September 2014. Conclusions These results demonstrate that this rodent species has now been extirpated on Bramble Cay. The vegetation decline was probably due to ocean inundation resulting from an increased frequency and intensity of weather events producing extreme high water levels and storm surges, in turn caused by anthropogenic climate change. Implications The loss of the Bramble Cay melomys from Bramble Cay probably represents the first documented mammalian extinction due to human-induced climate change.

Population modeling provides a quantitative method to integrate toxicity data with demographic data to understand the long-term effects of contaminants on population persistence. In this study we use laboratory-derived embryo and larval toxicity data for two anuran species to investigate the potential for toxicity to contribute to population declines. We use the southern toad (Anaxyrus terrestris) and the southern leopard frog (Lithobates sphenocephalus) as model species to investigate copper (Cu) toxicity. We use matrix models to project populations through time and quantify extinction risk (the probability of quasi-extinction in 35 yr). Life-history parameters for toads and frogs were obtained from previously published literature or unpublished data from a long-term (>35 yr) data set. In addition to Cu toxicity, we investigate the role of climate change on amphibian populations by including the probability of early pond drying that results in catastrophic reproductive failure (CRF, i.e., complete mortality of all larval individuals). Our models indicate that CRF is an important parameter for both species as both were unable to persist when CRF probability was >50% for toads or 40% for frogs. Copper toxicity alone did not result in significant effects on extinction risk unless toxicity was very high (>50% reduction in survival parameters). For toads, Cu toxicity and high probability of CRF both resulted in high extinction risk but no synergistic (or greater than additive) effects between the two stressors occurred. For leopard frogs, in the absence of CRF survival was high even under Cu toxicity, but with CRF Cu toxicity increased extinction risk. Our analyses highlight the importance of considering multiple stressors as well as species differences in response to those stressors. Our models were consistently most sensitive to juvenile and adult survival, further suggesting the importance of terrestrial stages to population persistence. Future models will incorporate multiple wetlands with different combinations of stressors to understand if our results for a single wetland result in a population sink within the landscape.

Although climate changes produce stress in ecological communities, few paleobiological studies have systematically addressed the impact of global climate changes on the fine details of community structure with a view to understanding how changes in community structure presage, or even cause, biodiversity decline during mass extinctions. Based on a novel Bayesian approach to biotope assessment, we present a study of changes in species abundance distribution patterns of macroplanktonic graptolite faunas (âˆ¼447-444 Ma) leading into the Late Ordovician mass extinction. Communities at two contrasting sites exhibit significant decreases in complexity and evenness as a consequence of the preferential decline in abundance of dysaerobic zone specialist species. The observed changes in community complexity and evenness commenced well before the dramatic population depletions that mark the tipping point of the extinction event. Initially, community changes tracked changes in the oceanic water masses, but these relations broke down during the onset of mass extinction. Environmental isotope and biomarker data suggest that sea surface temperature and nutrient cycling in the paleotropical oceans changed sharply during the latest Katian time, with consequent changes in the extent of the oxygen minimum zone and phytoplankton community composition. Although many impacted species persisted in ephemeral populations, increased extinction risk selectively depleted the diversity of paleotropical graptolite species during the latest Katian and early Hirnantian. The effects of long- Term climate change on habitats can thus degrade populations in ways that cascade through communities, with effects that culminate in mass extinction.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84979703515&doi=10.1073%2fpnas.1602102113&partnerID=40&md5=25f695ea906545e11acd7dd22148fe33,NA,NA,Article,NA,Scopus,NA,cited By 21,NA,NA,8380-8385,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,C:/Users/gmath/Documents/3.PhD/lit_review_past_climate/bibliography/scopus.bib,1,Graptolite Community Responses to Global Climate Change and the Late Ordovician Mass Extinction.,selected,NA,selected

The stratospheric soot was ejected from the oil-rich area by the asteroid impact and was spread globally. The soot aerosols caused sufficiently colder climates at mid-high latitudes and drought with milder cooling at low latitudes on land, in addition to causing limited cessation of photosynthesis in global oceans within a few months to two years after the impact, followed by surface-water cooling in global oceans in a few years.

We assessed 1900-2100 change in suitable climate and land cover in the historic range of Carolina parakeet (Conuropsis carolinensis), ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis) and passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius), in North America. Parakeet and woodpecker historic range currently remains climatically-favourable, but intensified land use has broadly reduced habitat in contemporary landscapes. For passenger pigeon, more substantive loss in climate and land cover suitability exists in both the historic full range and primary breeding range. Long-term climate and land cover projections suggest that improved habitat suitability and increased potential future distribution outside historic ranges are likely for each de-extinction candidate. While such changes could improve probability of success for de-extinction programs, extensive mismatch between historic and future habitat suitability highlights the potential risks of reviving species that may colonize novel geographic space. To date, potential long-term negative effects of de-extinction programs to ecosystems outside historic ranges have not been elucidated, making this a priority concern for any serious proposal.

Therefore, host dependency in species living in parasitic relationships is acknowledged as a crucial factor increasing climatic susceptibility and species decline. In Maculinea butterflies and Myrmica ants, a complex form of social parasitism brings the butterflies into dependency of some few associated ant species for reproductive success. We evaluated to what extent these relations can be attributed to similarity in their climatic niches and whether alterations in niche overlap might foster the climatic susceptibility in Maculinea butterflies under future climate change. We show that the niches of ants and butterflies differ significantly more than expected at random corresponding to the observed flexibility in host exploitation. Moreover, a generally low degree of niche overlap and similar niche overlap scores between main and secondary host associations argue for a low host specificity of Maculinea butterflies. Pronounced range shifts and habitat retractions in all species will result in severe spatial limitations of Maculinea species by the presence of their hosts. No tightening in any of the host-parasite associations was detected under the pressure of range restrictions. Niche overlap scores remain comparably low in future scenarios and call for the possibility of extensive host shifts between all related species. Therefore, the absence of niche constraints might enable the parasites to extensively shift among hosts to allow the co-occurrence of several Maculinea species, in principle using the same host, and to maintain viable populations under the pressure of limited distributions and changing environments.

However, the potential impact of climate change on the extinction risk of species remains poorly understood, particularly in comparison to other current threats. The objective of this research was to examine the relative impact of climate change on extinction risk of upper montane tree species in the tropical Andes, an area of high biodiversity value that is particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts. The extinction risk of 129 tree species endemic to the region was evaluated according to the IUCN Red List criteria, both with and without the potential impacts of climate change. Evaluations were supported by development of species distribution models, using three methods (generalized additive models, recursive partitioning, and support vector machines), all of which produced similarly high AUC values when averaged across all species evaluated (0.82, 0.86, and 0.88, respectively). Inclusion of climate change increased the risk of extinction of 18-20% of the tree species evaluated, depending on the climate scenario. The relative impact of climate change was further illustrated by calculating the Red List Index, an indicator that shows changes in the overall extinction risk of sets of species over time. A 15% decline in the Red List Index was obtained when climate change was included in this evaluation. While these results suggest that climate change represents a significant threat to tree species in the tropical Andes, they contradict previous suggestions that climate change will become the most important cause of biodiversity loss in coming decades. Conservation strategies should therefore focus on addressing the multiple threatening processes currently affecting biodiversity, rather than focusing primarily on potential climate change impacts.

However, there has been a limited knowledge on how synergistic effects occur and individual roles of different drivers are not often considered. Therefore, it becomes quite challenging to manage multiple threatening processes simultaneously in order to mitigate biodiversity loss. In this regard, our hypothesis is, if the traits actually play different roles in the synergistic interaction, conservation efforts could be made more effectively. To understand the synergistic effect and test our hypothesis, we examined the processes associated with the endangerment of critically endangered Chinese Crested Tern (Thalasseus bernsteini), whose total population number was estimated no more than 50. Through monitoring of breeding colonies and investigations into causative factors, combined with other data on human activities, we found that widespread human harvest of seabird eggs and increasing frequency of typhoons are the major factors that threatened the Chinese Crested Tern. Furthermore, 28 percent of breeding failures were due to the synergistic effects in which egg harvest-induced renestings suffered the higher frequent typhoons. In such combined interactions, the egg harvest has clearly served as a proximal factor for the population decline, and the superimposition of enhanced typhoon activity further accelerated the species toward imminent extinction. Our findings suggest that species endangerment, on one hand, should be treated as a synergistic process, while conservation efforts, on the other hand, should focus principally on combatting the threat that triggers synergistic effects.

The resulting communities arise from the idiosyncratic responses of species to future changes, which ultimately relate to both shrinking and expanding species ranges. While spatial patterns of colonisation and extirpation events have received great attention, the identification of specific drivers remains poorly explored. This study aims to investigate the relative contribution of species gain and loss to the turnover of fish assemblages in French rivers under future climate change, and to identify their principal drivers. Future projections of potential habitat suitability in 2080 derived from species distribution models for 40 fish species showed that colonisations and extirpations could play counterbalancing roles in the reshuffling of communities. Simultaneously, these two processes exhibited patchy spatial patterns, segregated along the longitudinal and altitudinal gradients, resulting in dramatic species turnover of âˆ¼ 60% of the current composition of species assemblages. Beyond the effect of topographic location, colonisations were found to be driven by temperature seasonality while extirpations were affected by modifications in both thermal and precipitation regimes. These results generate the possibility of developing ecosystem-based management tools focused on the early identification of areas where particular species may be sensitive to climate changes. Disentangling the drivers of colonisation and extirpation processes provides ready-to-use information that may be easily integrated into conservation planning. This information could be used to identify potential hotspots of species gain and loss and to then compare these hotspots with newly favourable areas so as to consider their actual accessibility in order to facilitate future range shifts.

MethodsWe used morphological, molecular and ecological evidence to assess the specific status of the potential new species. We gathered distribution data to conduct climate-based distribution modelling of present and future occupancy under several SRES emission scenarios. ResultsThe existence of a new non-cryptic species of ant (Lasius balearicus Talavera, Espadaler \& Vila, sp. nov.) is described from the island of Mallorca. Its distribution was found to be extremely restricted (Serra de Tramuntana) and elevationally constrained to island summits (between 800 and 1400m a.s.l.). Molecular dating indicated that this species diverged about 1.51million years ago from its nearest relatives, from which it can be distinguished based on several morphological traits. Ecological niche modelling shows a dramatic reduction of areas with suitable climatic conditions under the different scenarios studied. Main conclusionsLasius balearicus represents the first endemic ant to be described in the Balearic Islands, as well as the first endemic Lasius species in the Mediterranean islands. Distribution modelling predictions, the low intraspecific genetic diversity observed, and the geographical and elevational isolation of the populations indicated a low probability for the survival of the species in the short term, thus making it a potential model to study real-time climate-based biodiversity loss. As a consequence, we strongly recommend including L. balearicus in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species under the category Endangered'.

We performed stochastic projections of viability response to an increase in maximum growing-season temperature of 18C over the next 70 years by sampling matrices from long-term demographic studies of 12 populations (representing 75 population-years of data). In simulations that included harvest and climate change, extinction risk at the median population size (N = 140) was 65%, far exceeding the additive effects of the two factors (extinction risk = 8% and 6% for harvest and climate change, respectively; quasi-extinction threshold = 20). We performed a life table response experiment (LTRE) to determine underlying causes of the effect of warming and harvest on deterministic Î» (kd). Together, these factors decreased kd values primarily by reducing growth of juvenile and small adult plants to the large-adult stage, as well as decreasing stasis of the juveniles and large adults. The interaction observed in stochastic model results followed from a nonlinear increase in extinction risk as the combined impact of harvest and warming consistently reduced Î» values below the demographic tipping point of Î» = 1. While further research is needed to create specific recommendations, these findings indicate that ginseng harvest regulations should be revised to account for changing climate.

Each of these factors was negatively associated with active season adult survival rates in binomial generalized linear models. We then used these relationships to back-cast adult survival with dynamic climate variables from 1950 to 2008 using spatially explicit demographic models. Demographic models for 189 population locations predicted known extant and extirpated populations well (AUC = 0.75), and models based on climate and land cover variables were superior to models incorporating either of those effects independently. These results suggest that increasing frequencies and severities of extreme events, including drought and flooding, have been important drivers of the long-term spatiotemporal variation in a demographic rate. We provide evidence that this variation reflects nonadaptive sensitivity to climatic stressors, which are contributing to long-term demographic decline and range contraction for a species of high-conservation concern. Range-wide demographic modeling facilitated an understanding of spatial shifts in climatic suitability and exposure, allowing the identification of important climate refugia for a dispersal-limited species. Climate change vulnerability assessment provides a framework for linking demographic and distributional dynamics to environmental change, and can thereby provide unique information for conservation planning and management.

Reviews of climate change in Australia have identified that it is imposing additional stresses on biodiversity, which is already under threat from multiple human impacts. Aims. The present study aimed to determine the contributions of several factors to the demise of the koala in the Eden region in south-eastern New South Wales and, in particular, to establish to what extent climate change may have exacerbated the decline. Methods. The study built on several community-based koala surveys in the Eden region since 1986, verified through interviews with survey respondents. Historical records as far back as the late 19th century, wildlife databases and field-based surveys were used to independently validate the community survey data and form a reliable picture of changes in the Eden koala population. Analysis of the community survey data used a logistic model to assess the contribution of known threats to koalas, including habitat loss measured as changes in foliage projective cover, fire, increases in the human population and climate change in the form of changes in temperature and rainfall, to the regional decline of this species. Key results. We found a marked, long-term shrinkage in the distribution of the koala across the Eden region. Our modelling demonstrated that a succession of multiple threats to koalas from land use (human population growth and habitat loss) and environmental change (temperature increase and drought) were significant contributors to this decline. Conclusions. Climate change, particularly drought and rising temperatures, has been a hitherto hidden factor that has been a major driver of the decline of the koala in the Eden region. Implications.

Grouses are also currently threatened by habitat modification and human disturbance, and an assessment of the impact of multiple stressors is needed to predict the fate of Alpine populations of these birds in the next decades. We estimated the effect of climate change and human disturbance on a rock ptarmigan population living in the western Italian Alps by combining an empirical population modelling approach and stochastic simulations of the population dynamics under the a1B climate scenario and two different disturbance scenarios, represented by the development of a ski resort, through 2050.The early appearance of snow-free ground in the previous spring had a favorable effect on the rock ptarmigan population, probably through a higher reproductive success. On the contrary, delayed snowfall in autumn had a negative effect possibly due to a mismatch in time to molt to white winter plumage which increases predation risk. The regional climate model PROTHEUS does not foresee any significant change in snowmelt date in the study area, while the start date of continuous snow cover is expected to be significantly delayed. The net effect in the stochastic projections is a more or less pronounced (depending on the model used) decline in the studied population. The addition of extra-mortality due to collision with ski-lift wires led the population to fatal consequences in most projections. Should these results be confirmed by larger studies the conservation of Alpine populations would deserve more attention. To counterbalance the effects of climate change, the reduction of all causes of death should be pursued, through a strict preservation of the habitats in the present area of occurrence.

Models employed to make predictions regarding the impacts of climate change on species' distributions, and ultimately persistence, typically assume that interannual variability in environmental conditions is independent between years. However, the colour of environmental noise has been shown to affect extinction risk in populations occupying spatially static environments, and should therefore affect persistence during climate change. This study aims to investigate the importance of noise colour for extinction risk during climate-induced range shifts. Methods We use a spatially explicit coupled map lattice with a latitudinal gradient in climatic suitability, together with time series of environmental noise, to simulate periods of directional climate change and investigate the effects of noise colour on extinction risk and range size. Results Extinction risk increases with reddening of the environmental noise, and this effect is particularly pronounced over short time frames when climate change is rapid.

The extinction risk of metapopulations can be approximated through simple models, providing a regional snapshot of the extinction probability of a species. We evaluated the extinction risk of three species under different climate change scenarios in three different regions of the Mexican cloud forest, a highly fragmented habitat that is particularly vulnerable to climate change. Location Cloud forests in Mexico. Methods Using Maxent, we estimated the potential distribution of cloud forest for three different time horizons (2030, 2050 and 2080) and their overlap with protected areas. Then, we calculated the extinction risk of three contrasting vertebrate species for two scenarios: (1) climate change only (all suitable areas of cloud forest through time) and (2) climate and land-use change (only suitable areas within a currently protected area), using an explicit patch-occupancy approximation model and calculating the joint probability of all populations becoming extinct when the number of remaining patches was less than five. Results Our results show that the extent of environmentally suitable areas for cloud forest in Mexico will sharply decline in the next 70years. We discovered that if all habitat outside protected areas is transformed, then only species with small area requirements are likely to persist. With habitat loss through climate change only, high dispersal rates are sufficient for persistence, but this requires protection of all remaining cloud forest areas. Main conclusions Even if high dispersal rates mitigate the extinction risk of species due to climate change, the synergistic impacts of changing climate and land use further threaten the persistence of species with higher area requirements.

Climate change altered community richness the most when species had narrow niches, when mean community-wide dispersal rates were low and when species differed in dispersal abilities. With high interspecific dispersal variance, the best dispersers tracked climate change, out-competed slower dispersers and caused their extinction. Overall, competition slowed the advance of colonists into newly suitable habitats, creating lags in climate tracking.

We examined Middle Ordovician-Early Silurian North American fossil occurrences within a spatiotemporally explicit stratigraphic framework that allowed us to quantify rock record effects on a per-taxon basis and assay the interplay of macrostratigraphic and macroecological variables in determining extinction risk. Genera that had large proportions of their observed geographic ranges affected by stratigraphic truncation or environmental shifts at the end of the Katian stage were particularly hard hit. The duration of the subsequent sampling gaps had little effect on extinction risk, suggesting that this extinction pulse cannot be entirely attributed to rock record failure; rather, it was caused, in part, by habitat loss. Extinction risk at this time was also strongly influenced by the maximum paleolatitude at which a genus had previously been sampled, a macroecological trait linked to thermal tolerance. A model trained on the relationship between 16 explanatory variables and extinction patterns during the early Katian interval substantially underestimates the extinction of exclusively tropical taxa during the late Katian interval.

It has been reported that coincident with this extinction the carbon isotopic composition of preserved eggshells of the extant emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) shows an abrupt dietary shift from tropical grasses (C4 photosynthesis) to temperate grasses and/or woody browse (C3 photosynthesis). This abrupt shift has been interpreted as signalling ecosystem collapse due to landscape burning by humans. We evaluate an alternative interpretation, that the shift in diet was not abrupt, but gradual, and caused by the weakening of the Australian monsoon. Location Lake Eyre, central Australia. Methods We re-analysed a large, published dataset of emu diet delta(13)C (inferred from delta(13)C of preserved eggshells) spanning the last 140,000 years, using time-series analysis. Using Akaike's information criterion, we compared two contrasting models: (1) there was an abrupt shift in delta(13)C coincident with the extinction of Genyornis, assumed 47.5 ka; and (2) there was a gradual shift in delta(13)C, correlated with reconstructed water level in Lake Eyre, a proxy for monsoon intensity. Results There was little evidence of an abrupt shift in emu diet delta(13)C about 45-50 ka, but delta(13)C appeared to steadily decrease between about 80 and 30 ka.

Logistic regression indicated that cisco tended to occur in cooler, larger, and deeper lakes. Depending upon the amount of warming, 25-70% of cisco populations are predicted to be extirpated by 2100. In addition, cisco are influenced by the invasion of rainbow smelt, which prey on young cisco. Projecting current estimates of rainbow smelt spread and impact into the future will result in the extirpation of about 1% of cisco populations by 2100 in Wisconsin.

We use International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List criteria as a common scale to estimate extinction risks from a wide range of climate impacts, ecological responses, and methods of analysis, and we compare predictions with observations. Mean extinction probability across studies making predictions of the future effects of climate change was 7\% by 2100 compared with 15\% based on observed responses. After taking account of possible bias in the type of climate change impact analyzed and the parts of the world and taxa studied, there was less discrepancy between the two approaches: predictions suggested a mean extinction probability of 10\% across taxa and regions, whereas empirical evidence gave a mean probability of 14\%. As well as mean overall extinction probability, observations also supported predictions in terms of variability in extinction risk and the relative risk associated with broad taxonomic groups and geographic regions.

Observations of modern ecosystems indicate that feedback mechanisms between plant nutrient content, nitrogen cycling, and herbivore-plant interactions can vary between a nutrient accelerating mode favoring increased herbivore biomass and a nutrient decelerating mode characterized by reduced herbivore biomass. These alternate modes are determined largely by plant nitrogen content. Plant nitrogen content is known to be influenced by atmospheric CO2 concentrations, temperature, and precipitation. It is argued that Lateglacial climate change, particularly increases in atmospheric CO2, shifted herbivore-ecosystem dynamics from a nutrient accelerating mode to a nutrient decelerating mode at the end of the Pleistocene, leading to reduced megafaunal population densities. An examination of Sporormiella records - a proxy for megaherbivore biomass - indicates that megafaunal populations collapsed first in the east and later in the west, possibly reflecting regional differences in precipitation or vegetation structure. The fortuitous intersection of the climatically driven nitrogen sink, followed by any one or combination of subsequent anthropogenic, environmental, or extra-terrestrial mechanisms could explain why extinctions took place at the end of the Pleistocene rather than during previous glacial-interglacial cycles.

Thus, there is evidence that the hominins who lived in the Hula Valley inhabited a comparatively dry place. The disappearance of water plant species was partially the result of reduced seed dispersal by birds (ornitochory) as a result of the shrinkage of water bodies and their number along the Rift Valley.

The impacts of these shifts on species' population sizes and their abilities to persist in the face of climate change will depend on many factors including the distribution of individuals within species' ranges, the ability of species to migrate and remain at equilibrium with climate, and patterns of human land-use. Human land-use may be especially important in the Andes where anthropogenic activities above tree line may create a hard barrier to upward migrations, imperiling high-elevation Andean biodiversity. In order to better understand how climate change may impact the Andean biodiversity hotspot, we predict the distributional responses of hundreds of plant species to changes in temperature incorporating population density distributions, migration rates, and patterns of human land-use. We show that plant species from high Andean forests may increase their population sizes if able to migrate onto the expansive land areas above current tree line. However, if the pace of climate change exceeds species' abilities to migrate, all species will experience large population losses and consequently may face high risk of extinction. Using intermediate migration rates consistent with those observed for the region, most species are still predicted to experience population declines. Under a business-as-usual land-use scenario, we find that all species will experience large population losses regardless of migration rate. The effect of human land-use is most pronounced for high-elevation species that switch from predicted increases in population sizes to predicted decreases. The overriding influence of land-use on the predicted responses of Andean species to climate change can be viewed as encouraging since there is still time to initiate conservation programs that limit disturbances and/or facilitate the upward migration and persistence of Andean plant species.

This work evaluated 138 published radiocarbon dates for megafauna and 402 published dates for early (>8000 BP) South American archaeological sites. A total of 93 megafauna dates for 15 genera, and 110 archaeological dates on early human appearance, are robust enough to assess correspondence between last-appearance records of megafauna, first-appearance records of humans, and the Younger Dryas to Holocene climatic transition in six different regions of South America. Interesting patterns come to light, but are based on few dates, particularly in northern South America. No taxon other than Mylodon has >7 robust dates, and many taxa have less than 3 dates. Accordingly, an assessment of how likely it is that only a few dates will yield the youngest date in an underlying frequency distribution of dates was conducted, by applying probability and bootstrapping analyses to 27 dates on Mylodon from southern Patagonia, 26 of them from a single site. It was found that 15 dates out of a sample of 27 will commonly yield a date within 200 years of the youngest date in the sample. For that reason, and because even for a taxon with many dates it is likely that the youngest dated specimen pre-dates the actual time of extinction, most of the last-appearance dates are interpreted as recording the last time taxa were abundant on the landscape, rather than extinction per se. With those caveats in mind, on a continental scale most megafauna have last appearances after human arrival, but seem to last at least 1000 years after first human presence. Some taxa apparently survived >6000 years after humans entered South America and >1000 years after the end-Pleistocene climatic changes. Last-appearance patterns for megafauna differ from region to region, but in Patagonia, the Argentine and Uruguayan Pampas, and Brazil, extinctions seem more common after humans arrive and during intensified climatic change between 11.2 and 13.5 ka. This pattern suggests that a synergy of human impacts and rapid climate change-analogous to what is happening today-may enhance extinction probability. Nevertheless, even in these regions, some megafauna persisted for thousands of years after human arrival and after the climate warmed. These results highlight the need for future intensive dating efforts on South American megafauna and archaeological remains.

Using demographic data gathered in both drought and nondrought years between 1996-2003 in central Arizona upper Sonoran Desert, we modeled population viability for the federally endangered Purshia subintegra (Kearney) Henrickson (Arizona cliffrose). We used deterministic matrix projection models and stochastic models simulating weather conditions during our study, given historical weather variation and under scenarios of increased aridity. Our models suggest that the P. subintegra population in Verde Valley is slowly declining and will be at greater risk of extinction with increased aridity. Across patches at a fine spatial scale, demographic performance was associated with environmental factors. Moist sites (patches with the highest soil moisture, lowest sand content, and most northern aspects) had the highest densities, highest seedling recruitment, and highest risk of extinction over the shortest time span. Extinction risk in moist sites was exacerbated by higher variance in recruitment and mortality. Dry sites had higher cumulative adult survival and lower extinction risk but negative growth rates. Steps necessary for the conservation of the species include introductions at more northern latitudes and in situ manipulations to enhance seedling recruitment and plant survival. We demonstrate that fine spatial-scale modeling is necessary to predict where patches with highest extinction risk or potential refugia for rare species may occur. Because current climate projections for the 21st century imply range shifts at rates of 300 to 500 km/century, which are beyond even exceptional examples of shifts in the fossil record of 100-150 km, it is likely that preservation of many rare species will require human intervention and a long-term commitment.

We also found that model fit decreases with decreasing distribution size, resulting in high prediction uncertainty among narrowly distributed species. High prediction uncertainty creates a conservation dilemma in that excluding these species under-predicts extinction risk and favors mistaken inaction on global warming.

Recent studies have demonstrated significant variability in model projections and there remains a need to test the accuracy of models and to reduce uncertainties. Testing of models has been limited by a lack of data against which projections of future ranges can be tested. Here we provide a first test of the predictive accuracy of such models using observed species' range shifts and climate change in two periods of the recent past. Location Britain. Methods Observed range shifts for 116 breeding bird species in Britain between 1967 and 1972 (t(1)) and 1987-91 (t(2)) are used. We project range shifts between t(1) and t(2) for each species based on observed climate using 16 alternative models (4 methods x 2 data parameterizations x 2 rules to transform probabilities of occurrence into presence and absence records). Results Modelling results were extremely variable, with projected range shifts varying both in magnitude and in direction from observed changes and from each other.

Approximately 67% of the species in peat-forming mires, and at least half the species in clastic wetlands were eliminated by changing climatic conditions, probably protracted moisture deficits or exaggeration of seasonal dryness. Independent studies suggest that the end of the Westphalian was marked by deglaciation in Gondwana and increase in global temperature. In peat-forming habitats major fioristic changes followed the extinction. Earliesta Stephanian (Late Pennsylvanian) dominance-diversity patterns were highly variable temporally; several different plant groups that were of minor importance in Westphalian mires became major framework dominants, with high coal to coal variability. Ultimately opportunistic tree ferns, previously subdominant, became the dominant elements. Westphalian tree ferns were mostly small, cheaply constructed colonists with massive reproductive outputs and broad ecological amplitudes. Stephanian tree ferns were much larger and appear to have occupied sites for extended periods; they retained the cheap construction of earlier forms but added massive root mantles, which permitted greater height and girth. The 'marsh'-forming lycopsid Chaloncria also became common in Stephanian mires. These elements formed mire landscapes that had few analogues in the older Westphalian mire forests, dominated by tree lycopsids. Generic dominance patterns in the Stephanian became fairly consistent after the initial period of irregularity; however, the species composition of Stephanian mires was highly variable within generic themes. Ecological assemblages were persistent during most of the Westphalian and Stephanian. Patterns at the end-Westphalian suggest that high levels of species extinction disrupt self-regulatory properties of groups of species and create intervals of lottery-like ecological dynamics. Opportunists may have an advantage during these periods, but ultimately they must give rise to species capable of site occupation. Thus the size of the extinction, and the proximity of existing species that can recolonize vacated resource space, will dictate whether speciation or colonization will rebuild the new landscapes.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0043138120&doi=10.1144%2fGSL.SP.1996.001.01.14&partnerID=40&md5=3d52610c35dfc041c2d462c44f863963,NA,NA,Article,NA,Scopus,NA,cited By 48,NA,NA,201-221,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,C:/Users/gmath/Documents/3.PhD/lit_review_past_climate/bibliography/scopus.bib,2,"Climate Change, Plant Extinctions and Vegetational Recovery During the Middle-Late Pennsylvanian Transition: The Case of Tropical Peatforming Environments in North America.",selected,NA,selected

Lycospora spp. (derived from arborescent lycopsids) became extinct along with some other palynomorph taxa. This investigation is concerned with the importance of this major floral change. Samples were studied from western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, and West Virginia (from a previous study) cover the stratigraphic interval from the Upper Freeport coal bed, uppermost part of the Allegheny Formation, to the Mahoning, Mason, Brush Creek, Wilgus, and Anderson coal beds in the lower part of the Conemaugh Formation. The floral change occurs either at or below the accepted Desmoinesian-Missourian boundary in the Midcontinent and Illinois basin, whereas in the northern Appalachians this change occurs in the lower part of the Conemaugh Formation, between the Mahoning and Brush Creek coal beds, or when the Mason is present, between the Mahoning and Mason coal beds. With the advent of late Middle Pennsylvanian time, the climate began to change from wet tropical to seasonal tropical. The Middle-Upper Pennsylvanian boundary is the culmination of this drying trend, which was marked by reduction of available water. The peat swamps are interpreted as having changed from the domed type of bog to the planar type under these circumstances. Thus, in general, the coals of the Conemaugh Formation are characteristically much thinner than those of the Allegheny Formation. This was caused by a number of factors including reduced or more seasonal rainfall, decline of arborescent lycopsids, and the increased dominance of herbaceous and fern plants. As a result, there are fewer minable coal beds in the Conemaugh Formation. The first coal bed above the extinction of Lycospora spp. is dominated by the palynomorph taxon Endosporites globiformis which is derived from a heterosporous, herbaceous lycopsid. However, Sigillaria, another arborescent lycopsid, did not become extinct at this time as evidenced by the presence of the palynomorph genus Crassispora which is derived from Sigillaria. The reason for the survival of Sigillaria is not known, but it may have been able to adapt, in a limited fashion, to some sort of specialized microenvironment. The ferns, based on palynomorph occurrence, become numerically more important throughout the balance of the Conemaugh Formation, and dominate the Pittsburgh No. 8 and Pomeroy coal beds in the overlying Monogahela Formation.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0029730302&doi=10.1016%2f0034-6667%2895%2900027-5&partnerID=40&md5=9c6a7bd97340f4605e005e1dd47da473,NA,NA,Article,NA,Scopus,NA,cited By 31,NA,NA,113-140,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,C:/Users/gmath/Documents/3.PhD/lit_review_past_climate/bibliography/scopus.bib,1,Late Pennsylvanian Climate Changes and Palynomorph Extinctions.,selected,NA,selected

Such terrestrially induced abrupt climate transitions could have contributed to biotic crises in earth history. Ancillary events associated with transitions could disperse unstable climate behavior over a longer but still geologically brief interval and account for the stepwise nature of some extinction events. There is a growing body of theoretical and empirical support for the concept of abrupt climate change, and a comparison of paleoclimate data with the Phanerozoic extinction record indicates that climate and biotic transitions often coincide. However, more stratigraphic information is needed to precisely assess phase relations between the two types of transitions. The climate-life comparison also suggests that, if climate change is significantly contributing to biotic turnover, ecosystems may be more sensitive to forcing during the early stages of evolution from an ice-free to a glaciated state.

Sustained increases in temperature might lead to local extinctions of tsetse populations. Extinction probabilities for tsetse populations have not so far been estimated as a function of temperature. We develop a time-homogeneous branching process model for situations where tsetse live at different levels of fixed temperature. We derive a probability distribution pk(T) for the number of female offspring an adult female tsetse is expected to produce in her lifetime, as a function of the fixed temperature at which she is living. We show that pk(T) can be expressed as a geometric series: its generating function is therefore a fractional linear type. We obtain expressions for the extinction probability, reproduction number, time to extinction and growth rates. The results are valid for all tsetse, but detailed effects of temperature will vary between species. No G. m. morsitans population can escape extinction if subjected, for extended periods, to temperatures outside the range 16ËšCâ€“32ËšC. Extinction probability increases more rapidly as temperatures approach and exceed the upper and lower limits.

Small decreases or increases in constant temperature in the neighbour-hoods of 16ËšC and 31ËšC, respectively, can drive tsetse populations to extinction.

A significant step forward would single out reliably landscape effects, given their constraining role and relative ease of theoretical manipulation. Here, we address population dynamics in ecosystems where the substrates for ecological interactions are mountain landscapes subject to climate warming. We use a minimalist model of metapopulation dynamics based on virtual species (i.e. a suitable assemblage of focus species) where dispersal processes interact with the spatial structure of the landscape. Climate warming is subsumed by an upward shift of species habitat altering the metapopulation capacity of the landscape and hence species viability. We find that the landscape structure is a powerful determinant of species survival, owing to the specific role of the predictably evolving connectivity of the various habitats. Range shifts and lags in tracking suitable habitat experienced by virtual species under warming conditions are singled out in different landscapes. The range of parameters is identified for which these virtual species (characterized by comparable viability thus restricting their possible fitnesses and niche widths) prove unable to cope with environmental change. The statistics of the proportion of species bound to survive is identified for each landscape, providing the temporal evolution of species range shifts and the related expected occupation patterns.

Consequently, how sexual selection influences population adaption and persistence under stress remains widely debated. Here, we present two empirical investigations of the fitness consequences of sexual selection on populations of the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella, exposed to stable or gradually increasing temperatures. When faced with increasing temperatures, strong sexual selection was associated with both increased fecundity and offspring survival compared with populations experiencing weak sexual selection, suggesting sexual selection acts to drive adaptive evolution by favouring beneficial alleles. Strong sexual selection did not, however, delay extinction when the temperature became excessively high. By manipulating individualsâ€™ mating opportunities during fitness assays, we were able to assess the effect of multiple mating independently from the effect of population-level sexual selection, and found that polyandry has a positive effect on both fecundity and offspring survival under increasing temperatures in those populations evolving with weak sexual selection. Within stable temperatures, there were some benefits from strong sexual selection but these were not consistent across the entire experiment, possibly reflecting changing costs and benefits of sexual selection under stabilizing and directional selection. These results indicate that sexual selection can provide a buffer against climate change and increase adaptation rates within a continuously changing environment. These positive effects of sexual selection may, however, be too small to protect populations and delay extinction when environmental changes are relatively rapid.

Specifically, we recognise that few studies indicate thermal shifts as the proximal cause of species extinctions; rather, species interactions exacerbated by temperature result in extinctions. Using microcosm-based experiments, as models of larger landscape processes, we test hypotheses that would be problematic to address through field work. A text-book predatorâ€“prey system (the ciliates Didinium and Paramecium) was used to compare three landscapes: an unfragmented landscape subjected to uniform temperatures (10, 20, 30Â°C); a fragmented landscape (potentially hosting metapopulations) subjected to these three temperatures; and a fragmented landscape subjected to a spatial temperature gradient (âˆ¼ 10 to 30Â°C) â€“ despite the prevalence of natural temperature ecoclines this is the first time such an analysis has been conducted. Initial thermal response-analysis (growth, mortality, and movement measured between 10 and 30Â°C) suggested that as temperature increased, the predator might drive the prey to extinction. Thermal preferences (measured at 5 temperatures between 10 and 30Â°C), indicated that both predator and prey preferred warmer temperatures, with the predator exhibiting the stronger preference, suggesting that cooler regions might act as a prey-refuge. The landscape level observations, however, did not entirely support the predictions. First, in the unfragmented landscape, increased temperature led to extinctions, but at the highest temperature (where the predator growth can be reduced) the prey survived. Second, at high temperatures the fragmented landscape failed to host metapopulations that would allow predatorâ€“prey persistence. Third, the thermal ecocline did not provide heterogeneity that improved stability; rather it forced both species to occupy a smaller realized space, leading toward extinctions. These findings reveal that temperature-impacted rates and temperature preferences combine to drive predatorâ€“prey dynamics and persistence across landscapes.

For insects, tolerance to high temperatures decreases with latitude, suggesting that similar patterns may exist along elevational gradients as well. This study explored how CTmax varies among species and populations of a group of diverse tropical insect herbivores, the rolled-leaf beetles, across both broad and narrow elevational gradients. Data from 6,948 field observations and 8,700 museum specimens were used to map the elevational distributions of rolled-leaf beetles on two mountains in Costa Rica. CTmax was determined for 1,252 individual beetles representing all populations across the gradients. Initial morphological identifications suggested a total of 26 species with populations at different elevations displaying contrasting upper thermal limits. However, compared with morphological identifications, DNA barcodes (cytochrome oxidase I) revealed significant cryptic species diversity. DNA barcodes identified 42 species and haplotypes across 11 species complexes. These 42 species displayed much narrower elevational distributions and values of CTmax than the 26 morphologically defined species. In general, species found at middle elevations and on mountaintops are less tolerant to high temperatures than species restricted to lowland habitats. Species with broad elevational distributions display high CTmax throughout their ranges. We found no significant phylogenetic signal in CTmax, geography, or elevational range. The narrow variance in CTmaxvalues for most rolled-leaf beetles, especially high-elevation species, suggests that the risk of extinction of insects may be substantial under some projected rates of global warming.

However, quantifying the relative importance that each factor had in the extinction risk of species has been challenging, mostly due to the spatio-temporal biases of fossil records, which complicate the calibration of realistic and accurate ecological niche modeling. Here, we overcome this problem by using ecotypes, and not real species, to run our models. We created 40 ecotypes with different temperature requirements (mean temperature from -20 degrees C to 25 degrees C and temperature range from 10 degrees C to 40 degrees C) and used them to quantify the effect of climate change and human impact. Our results show that cold-adapted ecotypes would have been highly affected by past temperature changes in Europe, whereas temperate and warm-adapted ecotypes would have been positively affected by temperature change. Human impact affected all ecotypes negatively, and temperate ecotypes suffered the greatest impacts. Based on these results, the extinction of cold-adapted species like Mammuthus primigenius may be related to temperature change, while the extinction of temperate species, like Crocuta crocuta, may be related to human impact. Our results suggest that temperature change and human impact affected different ecotypes in distinct ways, and that the interaction of both impacts may have shaped species extinctions in Europe.",NA,NA,1365-2486,NA,WOS:000351214100011,NA,1354-1013,NA,NA,"LIMA-RIBEIRO, MATHEUS S./H-9503-2014 Diniz-Filho, JosÃ© Alexandre Felizola/D-9405-2013 Storch, David/C-3339-2017 Varela, Sara/J-7725-2016",1475-1481,"LIMA-RIBEIRO, MATHEUS S./0000-0002-3322-1702 Diniz-Filho, JosÃ© Alexandre Felizola/0000-0002-0967-9684 Storch, David/0000-0001-5967-1544 Varela, Sara/0000-0002-5756-5737",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,C:/Users/gmath/Documents/3.PhD/lit_review_past_climate/bibliography/web_of_science.bib,1,Differential Effects of Temperature Change and Human Impact on European Late Quaternary Mammalian Extinctions.,selected,NA,selected

The event is thought to have been triggered by the initiation of the volcanic eruptions of the Siberian Traps. The five million year recovery interval that followed the extinction event was strongly influenced by the environmental effects of sustained volcanic eruptions including extreme temperature events and persistent global and regional oxygen minimum zones. The effects of these environmental perturbations on the paleoecological recovery of the benthic marine fauna were studied in two depositional units from the Southwestern United States representing two substages during the Early Triassic recovery. The Smithian Sinbad Limestone was influenced by high sea surface temperatures and contains a relatively high diversity fauna that exhibits extremely small body size. Gastropods that lived in this environment were size-limited, a possible result of metabolic stress due to extreme temperatures. These microgastropods were able to become dominate components of the benthic fauna by occupying niche space vacated by other taxa that were excluded by high temperatures. The Spathian Virgin Limestone shows evidence for low oxygen conditions. The resulting low diversity benthic fauna had a more ecologically complex community structure than the Smithian Sinbad Limestone including the occupation of epifaunal tiering space by crinoids. As the prevalence of aerobic facies increased through time, diversity, body size, and the complexity of faunal interactions also increased suggesting that low oxygen conditions were the limiting factor for the benthic recovery in that region. The differences in diversity and community structure between the two units highlight the importance of environmental and temporal differences in driving the recovery patterns of the benthic fauna following the extinction event. High temperature events and low oxygen conditions restricted the benthic fauna in different ways but both contributed to the delay in recovery from the end-Permian mass extinction.

This study shows that this suborder disappears during stratigraphical intervals that are considered to be representative of low oxygen conditions in the Iberian Range. The collapse of marine ecosystems (affecting up to 40% of ostracod species) in the Elegantulum Subzone, Serpentinum Zone was most likely triggered by a sudden and widespread lethal increase in seawater temperature.

Many of these events have been linked to important climate changes. Two sections of the Toarcian showing high-resolution ammonite-based biostratigraphy are studied in Central and Northern Spain. Stable isotope datasets, based on the analysis of 192 diagenetically screened belemnite calcite and 41 bulk carbonates, allowed the construction of Î´13C curves and a Î´18O-based palaeotemperature. Comparison of the extinction pattern with other sections in Europe and northern Africa shows that the Early Toarcian mass extinction boundary occurred at the Tenuicostatum-Serpentinum transition, and that the organic-rich facies linked to the Oceanic Anoxic Event and the associated negative Î´13C excursion are diachronous. From a latest Pliensbachian cooling interval, a first increment of seawater temperature averaging about 4.5Â Â°C, started around the Pliensbachian-Toarcian boundary and developed during the earliest Toarcian Tenuicostatum Biochron, marking the beginning of the main extinction interval. From the Tenuicostatum-Serpentinum transition up to the Bifrons Biochron, a rise in seawater temperature averaging 5.7Â Â°C to 7.8Â Â°C was recorded. This warming interval, which started rapidly and which seems to be synchronous at least in Western Europe, is considered one of the main factors responsible for mass extinction. For some authors this rapid warming was probably due to a massive injection of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, but it does not seem to be recorded in belemnite calcite, and the origin of these possible gases is largely debated in the literature. Additional isotope excursions were found in the studied sections in Spain during the Middle and Late Toarcian. A negative Î´13Cbel excursion has been recorded at the latest Bifrons Biochron. Above this shift, the Illustris-Vitiosa subzones thermal peak, which represents a 2-3Â Â°C Î”T, could be linked to one of the tectonomagmatic activity peaks recorded in the Karoo Basin. A renewal in the ammonite and brachipod faunas coincident with this climatic change has been recognized in NW Europe and Western Tethys. An interesting thermal peak has also been detected in belemnites of the Insigne Subzone. Î”T is in the order of 3Â Â°C, and in both sections the thermal peak is included into a Î´13Cbel negative excursion of about - 1.5â€°. Relative synchrony with the new age for the Karoo main magmatic activity (178-180Â Ma) indicates that the Î´13C negative anomaly and the warming interval could be caused by the release of volcanogenic greenhouse gases. At this short interval, noteworthy changes in the abundance and diversity of the recorded assemblages in several faunal groups of NW Europe and Tethys are observed. The uppermost Levesquei Subzone thermal peak has only been recognized in the deposits of the section located in Central Spain and coincides with a positive Î´13C excursion. Â© 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Coral reef degradation in the eastern tropical Pacific has resulted from reductions in live coral cover, declines in coral species population abundances, local to regional scale extinctions, disruption of predator/prey spatial relations and relative abundances, bioerosion of reef frameworks, and low coral recruitment. None of the coral species that have suffered regional extinctions has reappeared after 15 years. Intense external and internal bioerosion by fishes, echinoids, lithophagine bivalves and clionid sponges has occurred on reefs affected by the 1982/83 El Nino coral bleaching event, and 1000-5000 year old reef frame-work accumulations in the Galapagos Islands have been completely eroded and reduced to gravel and sand.

To analyse the influence of different levels of autocorrelation in temperature records (ii) the day-to-day correlations were reduced by randomly permuting the sequence of days within the months of successive years from the database, (iii) year-to-year correlations were reduced by randomly rearranging the sequence of the years held in the database, (iv) combined day-to-day and year-to-year correlations were reduced according to the submodel (ii) and (iii), and finally (v) temperatures were randomly generated on the basis of Gaussian normal distributions. The mean and the variance of these distributions depended on the date of the year. Distributions were derived from the above mentioned meteorological database. We estimated highly different minimum viable population sizes. These did severely depend on the chosen temperature model. Values ranged from 3000 adults to more than a million adults per generation. High amounts of autocorrelation in temperature values decreased the extinction risk of a bush cricket population. Permuting the sequence of the years in the database increased extinction risk less than reducing day-to-day correlations. A decrease in autocorrelation of temperature records can result in unrealistic phenologies of life stages. Decreasing day-to-day or year-to-year autocorrelation in temperature records resulted in an increase or a decrease of the duration of the egg development or the duration of larval development. For poikilothermic species general implications are presented that are relevant for the design of quantitative models used in conservation biology.

In particular, periods of enhanced extinction in marine taxa (especially those from warmer waters) have frequently been linked to decreases in seawater temperature. Studies of the physiology of marine invertebrates and fish alive today have revealed well-developed abilities to cope with temperature change, and there would thus appear to be a dichotomy between the rates of temperature change associated with extinction in geological history and the very much faster rates (by several orders of magnitude) with which many marine organisms can cope today. Nevertheless, evidence from ecology and biogeography indicates that temperature, or some temperature-associated factor, does play a significant role in determining the limits to performance, and hence distribution. The resolution of the dichotomy between the evidence from paleontology and physiology may come through a consideration of the role of the previous evolutionary history of the fauna, the influence of sudden temperature events, or the impact of climatic change on individual competitive ability, community structure, and ecosystem functioning. Studies of the energetics of marine invertebrates in relation to temperature and the evolutionary history of polar faunas indicate that we should beware of anthropocentric judgements in attempting to understand the role of climatic change in evolutionary history, and be critical in distinguishing the role of temperature per se from temperature-associated ecological factors. Present evidence suggests that climatic change in the sea, at least at the rates currently believed to be typical, is unlikely to cause extinction by direct physiological impact. It is more likely that extinction is caused by ecological factors; temperature change is thus only one of several factors that may promote those ecological changes that are currently the best candidates for the proximate cause of extinction in the sea.

This is in large part because today they occur most abundantly in cooler waters associated with upwelling or other high-nutrient conditions, but thermal tolerances and preferences are unclear for extinct turritelline species. Turritellines were diverse and abundant throughout the New World for much of the Cenozoic. Beginning in the early Neogene, through both extinction and range contraction, however, they started to disappear from higher latitudes on both Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North and Central America. The highest rate of extinction took place in the western Atlantic in the Plio-Pleistocene, when almost all turritelline species in this area became extinct. Preliminary comparison of the available stratigraphic record suggests that this paleobiogeographic pattern is not an artefact of the record. This biogeographic shift coincides with a postulated regional mass extinction among all marine mollusks in the western Atlantic at around the same time. Causes for turritelline extinction, however, appear to be more complex than the decline in temperature that is cited most often as the probable cause of the western Atlantic molluskan extinction event. Neogene turritellines in the western Atlantic appear to have been adversely affected by collapse and/or major reorganization of oceanic productivity associated with the formation of the Isthmus of Panama. Nutrients thus may have been more important than temperature change in controlling extinction probability in this group.

The stratigraphic ranges of species of Gulf Coast molluscs reveal a stepwise extinction pattern from the late Middle Eocene to the Oligocene with a peak of extinctions at the Middle-Late Eocene boundary. Although several large transgressions and regressions of the Gulf Coast occurred during this interval, there is little or no correlation between the molluscan extinctions and shelf-area reduction. Temperature drops appear to be the primary cause of these extinctions. These conclusions corroborate the relationship between temperature and extinction seen by Stanley. Although the stepped nature of the extinctions argues against the single impact hypothesis as a cause, these extinctions correlate with sediments containing multiple microtektite horizons and stepped extinctions of planktonic foraminifera.

It remains unclear whether cooling, expanded oxygen deficiency, or a combination drove the Late Ordovician Mass Extinction (LOME). Here, we present combined iodine and sulfur isotope geochemical data from three globally distributed carbonate successions to constrain changes in local and global marine redox conditions. Iodine records suggest locally anoxic conditions were potentially pervasive on shallow carbonate shelves, while sulfur isotopes suggest a reduction in global euxinic (anoxic and sulfidic) conditions. Late Katian sulfate-sulfur isotope data show a large negative excursion that initiated during elevated sea level and continued through peak Hirnantian glaciation. Geochemical box modeling suggests a combination of decreasing pyrite burial and increasing weathering are required to drive the observed negative excursion suggesting a similar to 3\% decrease of global seafloor euxinia during the Late Ordovician. The sulfur datasets provide further evidence that this trend was followed by increases in euxinia which coincided with eustatic sea-level rise during subsequent deglaciation in the late Hirnantian. A persistence of shelf anoxia against a backdrop of waning then waxing global euxinia was linked to the two LOME pulses. These results place important constraints on local and global marine redox conditions throughout the Late Ordovician and suggest that non-sulfidic shelfal anoxia-along with glacioeustatic sea level and climatic cooling-were important environmental stressors that worsened conditions for marine fauna, resulting in the second-largest mass extinction in Earth history and the only example during an icehouse climate.",NA,e2021AV000563,2576-604X,NA,WOS:000763500400003,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,C:/Users/gmath/Documents/3.PhD/lit_review_past_climate/bibliography/web_of_science.bib,1,Geochemical Records Reveal Protracted and Differential Marine Redox Change Associated with Late Ordovician Climate and Mass Extinctions.,selected,NA,selected

As an island species, SNI foxes are inherently vulnerable because they evolved in isolation from many potential threats, and their small range features relatively simple and degraded habitats, limiting their population size and heightening susceptibility to climate-driven habitat changes. In the past decade, the SNI fox population has decreased by nearly half, spurring concern. Our analyses of 18 yr of trapping data suggest that both drought and density dependence contributed to this decline. Density dependence in survival acted on older individuals and its strength doubled after recent drought-induced habitat changes. Annual precipitation was a strong driver of pup production, but density dependence moderated precipitation benefits. Using a stochastic model with island-specific drivers of demography, we developed a risk isocline tool to predict 50-yr quasi-extinction risk based on population size and mortality. Predicted extinction risk for SNI foxes is currently <5\% and expected to decrease. Compared to the previously listed subspecies, risk isoclines indicate the SNI subspecies is more resistant to quasi-extinction at moderate population sizes and mortality rates, but quasi-extinction risk does not decline as rapidly at higher population sizes or lower mortality rates. Thus, limiting human-caused mortality and monitoring for novel threats such as exotic disease remain important. The ability of SNI foxes to increase pup production following high-rainfall low-density years is a key feature stabilizing their dynamics. Habitat- and location-specific dynamics produce substantial portfolio effects, whereby asynchrony in growth rates stabilizes overall population numbers, and restoration efforts that increase food resources and habitat diversity will further enhance the resilience of this population. Although the SNI fox appears to be rebounding, its recent decline may foreshadow future dynamics and serves as a cautionary tale for stewards of island species facing unprecedented climatic conditions, especially those inhabiting small and less diverse systems. Finally, our analyses highlight limitations in applying risk analyses from one population to related species, or even the same species in different habitat settings.",NA,e03724,NA,NA,WOS:000689453800013,NA,2150-8925,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,C:/Users/gmath/Documents/3.PhD/lit_review_past_climate/bibliography/web_of_science.bib,1,Understanding Extinction Risk and Resilience in an Extremely Small Population Facing Climate and Ecosystem Change.,selected,NA,selected

An ensemble of species distribution models was used to estimate the potential suitable habitat of species under different sets of climate, land-use and dispersal constraint scenarios. We then evaluated the vulnerability and extinction risk of individual species to changes in climate and land use, and examined whether rare, endangered and evolutionarily distinct species were disproportionally threatened by climate and land-use change. We show that similar to 2000 species may lose >80\% of their suitable habitats under the A1b emission scenario for the 2080s, while similar to 100 species may experience >80\% range expansions (a 20:1 ratio of loss to gain). When considering >50\% range retraction and expansion, the ratio of loss to gain was 13:1. A greater loss of species diversity is expected at low latitudes, while larger gains are expected at high latitudes. Evolutionarily distinct species are predicted to have significantly higher extinction risks than extant species.

Adapting some methods (e.g., a structured voting system) used during other assessments and developing some new approaches (e.g., integrated assessment of threats and demographic characteristics), we rated the importance of threats contributing to coral extinction risk and assessed those threats against population status and trend information to evaluate each species' extinction risk over the 21st century.

Here I review both the mechanisms and the evidence for and against the relevance of astronomical phenomena to climate change and evolution. This necessarily includes a critical assessment of time series analysis techniques and hypothesis testing. Some of the Studies have suffered from flaws in methodology, in particular drawing incorrect conclusions based on ruling out a null hypothesis. I conclude that there is little evidence for intrinsic periodicities in biodiversity, impact cratering or climate on timescales of tens to hundreds of Myr. Although this does not rule out the mechanisms, the numerous assumptions and uncertainties involved in the interpretation of the geological data and in particular in the astronomical mechanisms suggest that Galactic midplane and spiral arm crossings have little impact on biological or climate variation above background level. Non-periodic impacts and terrestrial mechanisms (volcanism, plate tectonics, sea level changes), possibly occurring simultaneously, remain likely causes of many environmental catastrophes. Internal dynamics of the biosphere may also play a role. In contrast, there is little evidence supporting the idea that cosmic rays have a significant influence on climate through cloud formation. It seems likely that more than one mechanism has contributed to biodiversity variations over the past half Gyr.",NA,NA,1475-3006,NA,WOS:000273383600010,NA,1473-5504,"42nd ESLAB Symposium on Cosmic Cataclysms and Life, ESA, ESRIN, Frascati, ITALY, NOV 10-14, 2008",NA,NA,213-239,NA,European Space Res Inst; European Astrobiol Network Assoc,NA,NA,NA,NA,C:/Users/gmath/Documents/3.PhD/lit_review_past_climate/bibliography/web_of_science.bib,1,The Evidence for and Against Astronomical Impacts on Climate Change and Mass Extinctions: a Review.,selected,NA,selected

Surprisingly, however, empirical and experimental data on the links between climate change and species introductions are scant, especially for invasive vertebrates. Because the theoretical basis for their mutually reinforced impact is strong, this dearth of evidence likely reflects the difficulty in studying such interactions, and insufficient attention to this topic, rather than a genuine lack of association. Given the unprecedented rate of recent and predicted future climate change, and the continued exponential rise in species invasions worldwide, it is imperative that we sharpen our scientific focus so as to best equip wildlife managers with the knowledge to tackle this inevitable synergy of threats.",NA,NA,1448-5494,NA,WOS:000256045500010,NA,1035-3712,NA,NA,"Brook, Barry W./G-2686-2011",249-252,"Brook, Barry W./0000-0002-2491-1517",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,C:/Users/gmath/Documents/3.PhD/lit_review_past_climate/bibliography/web_of_science.bib,1,"Synergies Between Climate Change, Extinctions and Invasive Vertebrates.",selected,NA,selected
